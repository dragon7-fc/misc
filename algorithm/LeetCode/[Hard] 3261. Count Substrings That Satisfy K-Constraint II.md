3261. Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint II

You are given a **binary** string `s` and an integer `k`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`.

A **binary string** satisfies the **k-constraint** if **either** of the following conditions holds:

* The number of `0`'s in the string is at most `k`.
* The number of `1`'s in the string is at most `k`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where answer[i] is the number of **substrings** of `s[li..ri]` that satisfy the **k-constraint**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "0001111", k = 2, queries = [[0,6]]

Output: [26]

Explanation:

For the query [0, 6], all substrings of s[0..6] = "0001111" satisfy the k-constraint except for the substrings s[0..5] = "000111" and s[0..6] = "0001111".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "010101", k = 1, queries = [[0,5],[1,4],[2,3]]

Output: [15,9,3]

Explanation:

The substrings of s with a length greater than 3 do not satisfy the k-constraint.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `1 <= k <= s.length`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
* `queries[i] == [li, ri]`
* `0 <= li <= ri < s.length`
* All queries are distinct.

**Solution 1: (Sliding Window, Count valid subarrays ending ast index i)**

__Intuition__

To solve the problem of counting substrings that meet the k-constraint, we need to ensure that for any substring to be counted, either the number of 0s or the number of 1s should be at most k. Given the constraints, directly checking each substring for each query would be inefficient. Instead, we can use a more sophisticated approach to preprocess the data and handle multiple queries efficiently.

__Approach__

Preprocessing with Sliding Window:

Use a sliding window to calculate the number of valid substrings ending at each index of the string. The window expands to include substrings as long as the count of 0s or 1s does not exceed k. When both counts exceed k, the window is adjusted from the left to bring the counts back within the constraint.
Store the count of valid substrings ending at each index in an array validSubstrings.
Prefix Sum Calculation:

Construct a prefix sum array where each position holds the cumulative count of valid substrings up to that index. This allows efficient range queries by storing cumulative counts.
Answer Queries:
For each query [l, r], compute the number of valid substrings within the range [l, r] using the difference between prefix sums. This leverages the precomputed prefix sums for fast query resolution.
