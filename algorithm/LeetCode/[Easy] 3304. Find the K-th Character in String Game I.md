3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a positive integer `k`.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation **forever**:

* Generate a new string by **changing** each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and **append** it to the original `word`.

For example, performing the operation on `"c"` generates `"cd"` and performing the operation on `"zb"` generates `"zbac"`.

Return the value of the `k`th character in word, after enough operations have been done for `word` to have at least `k` characters.

Note that the character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the operation.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: k = 5

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:

Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: k = 10

Output: "c"
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= k <= 500`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        string cur = "a";
        while (cur.size() < k) {
            int sz = cur.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < sz; i ++) {
                cur += cur[i]+1;
            }
        }
        return cur[k-1];
    }
};
```

**Solution 2: (Math)**

__Intuition__
Update k -= 1, we want to find s[k].

Consider k in binary format:
s[1xxx] is generated from s[xxx],
s[1xxx] = s[xxx] + 1
ex. s[3 = 0b11] = s[1 = 0b1] + 1


__Explanation__
Each bit means it's incremented once.

s[k] = s[0] + bits_count(k)

Just return bit count of k.


__Complexity__
Time O(logk)
Space O(1)
