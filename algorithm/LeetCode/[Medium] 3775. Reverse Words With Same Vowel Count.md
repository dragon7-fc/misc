3775. Reverse Words With Same Vowel Count

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English words, each separated by a single space.

Determine how many vowels appear in the **first** word. Then, reverse each following word that has the **same vowel count**. Leave all remaining words unchanged.

Return the resulting string.

Vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "cat and mice"

Output: "cat dna mice"

Explanation:

The first word "cat" has 1 vowel.
"and" has 1 vowel, so it is reversed to form "dna".
"mice" has 2 vowels, so it remains unchanged.
Thus, the resulting string is "cat dna mice".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "book is nice"

Output: "book is ecin"

Explanation:

The first word "book" has 2 vowels.
"is" has 1 vowel, so it remains unchanged.
"nice" has 2 vowels, so it is reversed to form "ecin".
Thus, the resulting string is "book is ecin".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "banana healthy"

Output: "banana healthy"

Explanation:

The first word "banana" has 3 vowels.
"healthy" has 2 vowels, so it remains unchanged.
Thus, the resulting string is "banana healthy".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
* Words in `s` are separated by a single space.
* `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
