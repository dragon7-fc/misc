1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences

You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of binary is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

* For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the good subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: binary = "001"
Output: 2
Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["0", "0", "1"].
The unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: binary = "11"
Output: 2
Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "1", "11"].
The unique good subsequences are "1" and "11".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: binary = "101"
Output: 5
Explanation: The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "0", "1", "10", "11", "101"]. 
The unique good subsequences are "0", "1", "10", "11", and "101".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= binary.length <= 10^5`
* `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

**Solution 1: (DP)**

**Intuition**

An easier or harder version of `940. Distinct Subsequences II`


**Explanation**

the subsequence 0 is tricky,
so firstly we only count the case without any leading 0

We count the number of subsequence that ends with 0 and ends with 1.

If we meed 0,
we can append 0 to all existing ends0 + ends1 subsequences,
and make up ends0 + ends1 different subsequences that ends with 0.
ans these subsequences has length >= 2,
So ends0 = ends0 + ends1.

If we meed 1, the same,
we can append 1 to all existing ends0 + ends1 subsequence,
and make up ends0 + ends1 different subsequence that ends with 1,
ans these subsequences has length >= 2.
So 1 is not in them, ends1 = ends0 + ends1 + 1.

The result is ends1 + ends2, and don't forget about 0.
The final result is ends1 + ends2 + has0.


**Complexity**

* Time `O(n)`
* Space `O(1)`

            dp[int(c)] = (sum(dp) + int(c)) % mod
        return (sum(dp) + ('0' in binary)) % mod
