2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter

You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of `s` of length `k` that has the letter `letter` appear **at least** `repetition` times. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` **at least** repetition times.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
Output: "eet"
Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
- "lee" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "eet" (from "leet")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
```

**Example 2:**

![img/2030_smallest-k-length-subsequence.png](img/2030_smallest-k-length-subsequence.png)
```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
Output: "ecde"
Explanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
Output: "bb"
Explanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least repetition

**Solution 1: (Greedy, Stack)**

This question reminds me of 316-Remove Duplicate Letters, so I am going with a similar approach here.

I maintain a stack containing the built prefix of the output. Starting from left to right of the string s, for any character that can improve the lexicographical order, we will pop a character from the stack only if:
1. There are enough characters left to construct a k-size string.
2. If the character to be popped is the same as letter, then there should also be at least k character letter left.

When adding new element to stack, we just need to check if the stack is already full (has size of k), and if the character is not the same as letter, then also check if we are leaving enough space for the matching characters.

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            while stack and stack[-1] > c and (len(s) - i + len(stack) > k) and (stack[-1] != letter or n_letters > repetition):
                d = stack.pop()
                if d == letter:
                    repetition += 1
                
            if len(stack) < k:
                if c == letter:
                    stack.append(c)
                    repetition -= 1
                elif k - len(stack) > repetition:
                    stack.append(c)
            
            if c == letter:
