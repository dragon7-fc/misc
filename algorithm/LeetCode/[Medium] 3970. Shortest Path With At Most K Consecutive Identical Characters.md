3970. Shortest Path With At Most K Consecutive Identical Characters

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a **directed weighted** graph, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` represents a directed edge from node `ui` to node `vi` with weight `wi`.

You are also given a string `labels` of length `n`, where `labels[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`, and an integer `k`.

Return the **minimum** total edge weight of a path from node 0 to node `n - 1` such that the concatenation of the labels of the nodes along the path contains **at most** `k` consecutive identical characters. If no valid path exists, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

Use edges[2] = [0, 2, 3] to reach node 2 with a weight wi = 3.
The corresponding concatenation of labels is "ab", which satisfies at most k = 1 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

Use edges[0] = [0, 1, 1] to reach node 1 with weight wi = 1.
Use edges[1] = [1, 2, 1] to reach node 2 with weight wi = 1.
The corresponding concatenation of labels is "aab", which satisfies at most k = 2 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1]], labels = "aaa", k = 2

Output: -1

Explanation:

There is no valid path from node 0 to node 2 that satisfies at most k = 2 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is -1.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == labels.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]`
* `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
* `ui != vi`
* `1 <= wi <= 10^4`
* `labels` consists of lowercase English letters
* `1 <= k <= 50`
