1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes

Given `n` boxes, each box is given in the format `[status, candies, keys, containedBoxes]` where:

* `status[i]`: an integer which is `1` if `box[i]` is open and `0` if `box[i]` is closed.
* `candies[i]`: an integer representing the number of candies in `box[i]`.
* `keys[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes you can open with the key in `box[i]`.
* `containedBoxes[i]`: an array contains the indices of the boxes found in `box[i]`.

You will start with some boxes given in `initialBoxes` array. You can take all the `candies` in any open box and you can use the `keys` in it to open new boxes and you also can use the boxes you find in it.

Return the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules above.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: status = [1,0,1,0], candies = [7,5,4,100], keys = [[],[],[1],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 16
Explanation: You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2. Box 1 is closed and you don't have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.
In box 1, you will find 5 candies and box 3 but you will not find a key to box 3 so box 3 will remain closed.
Total number of candies collected = 7 + 4 + 5 = 16 candy.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: status = [1,0,0,0,0,0], candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1], keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [0]
Output: 6
Explanation: You have initially box 0. Opening it you can find boxes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and their keys. The total number of candies will be 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [100,1,100], keys = [[],[0,2],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: status = [1], candies = [100], keys = [[]], containedBoxes = [[]], initialBoxes = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: status = [1,1,1], candies = [2,3,2], keys = [[],[],[]], containedBoxes = [[],[],[]], initialBoxes = [2,1,0]
Output: 7
``` 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= status.length <= 1000`
* `status.length == candies.length == keys.length == containedBoxes.length == n`
* `status[i]` is `0` or `1`.
* `1 <= candies[i] <= 1000`
* `0 <= keys[i].length <= status.length`
* `0 <= keys[i][j] < status.length`
* All values in `keys[i]` are unique.
* `0 <= containedBoxes[i].length <= status.length`
* `0 <= containedBoxes[i][j] < status.length`
* All values in `containedBoxes[i]` are unique.
* Each box is contained in one box at most.
* `0 <= initialBoxes.length <= status.length`
* `0 <= initialBoxes[i] < status.length`

**Solution 1: (BFS)**

This problem can be solved using BFS. In order to gather all the candies in some box `i`, this box must meet these requirements

* this box must be 'found' or reachable (`i in traveled`), and
* this box is open already (`status[i] == 1`) or we have a key to this box in the end (`i in foundKeys`)

    def maxCandies(self, status: List[int], candies: List[int], keys: List[List[int]], containedBoxes: List[List[int]], initialBoxes: List[int]) -> int:
        queue = initialBoxes.copy() # boxes to travel to
        foundKeys = set(initialBoxes) # keys we have found so far
        traveled = set() # boxes that have been traveled to so far. If a box is in this set, it means this box is reachable. Also this can be used to avoid cycles(although no cycles in this problem)

        while queue:
            size = len(queue)

            for _ in range(size):
                index = queue.pop(0)

                for boxIndex in containedBoxes[index]: # for every box inside this box
                    if boxIndex not in traveled:
                        queue.append(boxIndex) # travel to this box later

                foundKeys.update(keys[index]) # gather the keys we found in this box
                # or foundKeys = foundKeys | set(keys[index])
                
                traveled.add(index) # mark that this box has been traveled to and is reachable

        return sum(candies[i] for i in traveled if status[i] == 1 or i in foundKeys) # gather all candies from reachable boxes that are open already, or can be opened with a key
