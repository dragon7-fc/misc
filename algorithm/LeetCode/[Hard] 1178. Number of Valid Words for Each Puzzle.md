1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle

With respect to a given `puzzle` string, a `word` is valid if both the following conditions are satisfied:
* `word` contains the first letter of puzzle.
* For each letter in `word`, that letter is in `puzzle`.
    
    For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced", "cabbage", and "baggage"; while invalid words are "beefed" (doesn't include "a") and "based" (includes "s" which isn't in the puzzle).

Return an array answer, where `answer[i]` is the number of words in the given word list `words` that are valid with respect to the puzzle `puzzles[i]`.
 

**Example :**
```
Input: 
words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"], 
puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
Explanation:
1 valid word for "aboveyz" : "aaaa" 
1 valid word for "abrodyz" : "aaaa"
3 valid words for "abslute" : "aaaa", "asas", "able"
2 valid words for "absoryz" : "aaaa", "asas"
4 valid words for "actresz" : "aaaa", "asas", "actt", "access"
There're no valid words for "gaswxyz" cause none of the words in the list contains letter 'g'.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
* `4 <= words[i].length <= 50`
* `1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`
* `puzzles[i].length == 7`
* `words[i][j], puzzles[i][j]` are English lowercase letters.
* Each `puzzles[i]` doesn't contain repeated characters.
