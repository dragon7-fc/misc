1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the previous Monday.
Given `n`, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
```

                (weeks-1) * 7 * weeks // 2 +        # (0+7+14+28+..) adding 7 for weeks - 1 starting from the second one
                (2*weeks + days + 1) * days // 2)   # last week sum:  (weeks + 1) + .... + (weeks + 1) + (days - 1)
