2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix grid of size `n * n` with values in the range `[1, n^2]`. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which appears **twice** and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers `a` and `b`.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `ans` of size `2` where `ans[0]` equals to `a` and `ans[1]` equals to `b`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n`
* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is not equal to any of the `grid` members.
* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is equal to exactly two of the `grid` members.
* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` except two of them there is exatly one pair of `i, j `that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `grid[i][j] == x`.
