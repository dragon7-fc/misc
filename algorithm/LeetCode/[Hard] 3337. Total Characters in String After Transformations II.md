3337. Total Characters in String After Transformations II

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer `t` representing the number of transformations to perform, and an array `nums` of size `26`. In one transformation, every character in `s` is replaced according to the following rules:

* Replace `s[i]` with the **next** `nums[s[i] - 'a']` consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if `s[i] = 'a'` and `nums[0] = 3`, the character `'a'` transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"bcd"`.
* The transformation **wraps** around the alphabet if it exceeds `'z'`. For example, if `s[i] = 'y'` and nums[24] = 3, the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"zab"`.

Return the length of the resulting string after **exactly** `t` transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]

Output: 7

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):

'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "azbk", t = 1, nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 8

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'bc' as nums[0] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'b' becomes 'cd' as nums[1] == 2
'k' becomes 'lm' as nums[10] == 2
String after the first transformation: "bcabcdlm"
Final Length of the string: The string is "bcabcdlm", which has 8 characters.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= t <= 10^9`
* `nums.length == 26`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 25`

**Solution 1: (Matrix Exponentiation)**

__Intuition__
Use matrix exponentiation for efficient tranformations.

__Approach__
Transform the given 'nums' array into a 26x26 matrix representing a single transformation.

The 26x26 matrix represents transformations between characters. For example, transform[1][0] = 1 indicates that character 'a' can be transformed into character 'b', where 0 represents 'a' and 1 represents 'b'. Essentially, each row i represents the characters from which the i-th character can be derived, or which transformations produce the i-th character.

Then, exponentiate this matrix to the power of 't' (indicating 't' transformations) which can be done in log(t) time complexity.

Finally, multiply the frequency array of the given string with the transformed matrix to get the final frequencies, then return the sum of this array.

__Complexity__
Time complexity: O(log t * 26^3) [the 26^3 is the time complexity of matrix multiplication]
Space complexity: O(n + 26x26) => O(n)`
