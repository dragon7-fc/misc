3333. Find the Original Typed String II

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed **multiple** times.

You are given a string `word`, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a **positive** integer `k`.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least `k`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and "abbccdd".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 8

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "aabbccdd".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word = "aaabbb", k = 3

Output: 8
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^5`
* `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= k <= 2000`

**Solution 1: (Prefix sum + DP)**

__Approach__
There are couple of things I did:

Get all of the counting for groups of consecutive characters.
Tabulation: Count how many possible sum of each number I can get up to from 1 to k.
Prefix sum to calculate all of previous values that I want to get. This was a nice hack that I couldn't come up with during the contest. Without this, my contest solution costed me O(n * k * k) time complexity.

__Complexity__
Time complexity: O(n * k)
Space complexity: O(k)

        int sz = arr.size();
        long long total = arr[0];
        for(int i=1; i<sz; ++i) total = (total * arr[i]) % MOD;

        // DP ??
        long long dp[k], cpy[k];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
