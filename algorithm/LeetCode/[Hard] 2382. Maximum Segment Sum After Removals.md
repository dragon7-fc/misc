2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. For the `i`th query, the element in `nums` at the index `removeQueries[i]` is removed, splitting `nums` into different segments.

A **segment** is a contiguous sequence of **positive** integers in `nums`. A **segment sum** is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return an integer array `answer`, of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the maximum segment sum after applying the `i`th removal.

**Note:** The same index will **not** be removed more than once.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
Output: [16,5,3,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [3,2,11,0] and the maximum segment sum is 16 for segment [3,2,11].
Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment [3].
Query 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [16,5,3,0].
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length == removeQueries.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `0 <= removeQueries[i] < n`
* All the values of `removeQueries` are unique.

**Solution 1: (Do it backwards O(N))**

For nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1], the reverse process will be
add 1 : [0, 2, 0 ,0 ,0]
add 4 : [0, 2, 0 ,0 ,1]
add 2 : [0, 2, 5 ,0 ,1]
add 3 : [0, 2, 5, 6, 1]
add 0 : [1, 2, 5, 6, 1]

When an index q is added, extend the contiguous sequence by finding if q+1 or q-1 exists, and also record the value of the maximum segment sum. For example, before adding the 3rd element, there are two contiguous sequences, [2, 5] and [1], and we can extend it to a length 4 sequence after the 3rd element is added.
