3389. Minimum Operations to Make Character Frequencies Equal

You are given a string `s`.

A string `t` is called **good** if all characters of `t` occur the same number of times.

You can perform the following operations **any number of times**:

* Delete a character from `s`.
* Insert a character in `s`.
* Change a character in `s` to its next letter in the alphabet.

**Note** that you cannot change `'z'` to `'a'` using the third operation.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `s` **good**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "acab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

We can make s good by deleting one occurrence of character 'a'.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "wddw"

Output: 0

Explanation:

We do not need to perform any operations since s is initially good.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aaabc"

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can make s good by applying these operations:

Change one occurrence of 'a' to 'b'
Insert one occurrence of 'c' into s
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= s.length <= 2 * 104`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
