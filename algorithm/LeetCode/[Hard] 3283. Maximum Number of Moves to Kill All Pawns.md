3283. Maximum Number of Moves to Kill All Pawns

There is a `50 x 50` chessboard with **one** knight and some pawns on it. You are given two integers `kx` and `ky` where `(kx, ky)` denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.

Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:

* The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the **fewest** possible moves. **Note** that the player can select **any** pawn, it **might not** be one that can be captured in the **least** number of moves.
* In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight **may** pass other pawns **without** capturing them. **Only** the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Alice is trying to **maximize** the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to **minimize** them.

Return the **maximum** total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play **optimally**.

Note that in one **move**, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: kx = 1, ky = 1, positions = [[0,0]]

Output: 4

Explanation:
```
![3283_gif3.gif](img/3283_gif3.gif)
```
The knight takes 4 moves to reach the pawn at (0, 0).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: kx = 0, ky = 2, positions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]

Output: 8

Explanation:
```
![3283_gif4.gif](img/3283_gif4.gif)
```
Alice picks the pawn at (2, 2) and captures it in two moves: (0, 2) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 2).
Bob picks the pawn at (3, 3) and captures it in two moves: (2, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 3).
Alice picks the pawn at (1, 1) and captures it in four moves: (3, 3) -> (4, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 1).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: kx = 0, ky = 0, positions = [[1,2],[2,4]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Alice picks the pawn at (2, 4) and captures it in two moves: (0, 0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4). Note that the pawn at (1, 2) is not captured.
Bob picks the pawn at (1, 2) and captures it in one move: (2, 4) -> (1, 2).
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= kx, ky <= 49`
* `1 <= positions.length <= 15`
* `positions[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 49`
* All `positions[i]` are **unique**.
* The input is generated such that `positions[i] != [kx, ky]` for all `0 <= i < positions.length`.
