1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character

You are given a list of strings of the same length `words` and a string `target`.

Your task is to form `target` using the given `words` under the following rules:

* `target` should be formed from left to right.
* To form the `i`th character (`0`-indexed) of `target`, you can choose the `k`th character of the `j`th string in `words` if `target[i] = words[j][k]`.
* Once you use the `k`th character of the `j`th string of `words`, you can no longer use the `x`th character of any string in `words` where `x <= k`. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
* Repeat the process until you form the string `target`.

**Notice** that you can use **multiple characters** from the **same string** in words provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form `target` from `words`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["abcd"], target = "abcd"
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: words = ["abab","baba","abba","baab"], target = "abba"
Output: 16
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`
* All strings in `words` have the same length.
* `1 <= target.length <= 1000`
* `words[i]` and `target` contain only lowercase English letters.

            ans = dp(k + 1, i)  # Skip k_th index of words
            if charAtIndexCnt[(c, k)] > 0: # Take k_th index of words if found character `c` at index k_th
                ans += dp(k + 1, i + 1) * charAtIndexCnt[(c, k)]
                ans %= MOD
            return ans

        return dp(0, 0)
```

**Solution 2: (DP Bottom-Up with Counter)**

**Explanation**

res[j] means the number of ways to form target j first characters.


**Complexity**

* Time O(S(W + N)),
* Space O(N + S)

where N = target.length,
S = words[i].length,
W = words.length
