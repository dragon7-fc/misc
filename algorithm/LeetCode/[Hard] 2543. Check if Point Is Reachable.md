2543. Check if Point Is Reachable

There exists an infinitely large grid. You are currently at point `(1, 1)`, and you need to reach the point `(targetX, targetY)` using a finite number of steps.

In one step, you can move from point `(x, y)` to any one of the following points:

* `(x, y - x)`
* `(x - y, y)`
* `(2 * x, y)`
* `(x, 2 * y)`

Given two integers `targetX` and `targetY` representing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of your final position, return `true` if you can reach the point from `(1, 1)` using some number of steps, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: targetX = 6, targetY = 9
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to reach (6,9) from (1,1) using any sequence of moves, so false is returned.
**Example 2:**
```

```
Input: targetX = 4, targetY = 7
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,4) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) -> (2,7) -> (4,7).
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= targetX, targetY <= 10^9`

__Intuition__

Try go from (x, y) to (1,1)
Consider the reverse operation of
(x, y - x)
(x - y, y)
(2 * x, y)
(x, 2 * y)

that is
(x, y + x)
(x + y, y)
(x / 2, y) if x % 2 == 0
(x, y / 2) if y % 2 == 0


__Necessary Condition__

Assume x and y have a common divisor v bigger than 2,
Since
(x + y) % v == 0
(x / 2) % v == 0
(y / 2) % v == 0
No matter what operation we use, we can't reach (1,1)

To go from (x,y) to (1,1),
we have the necessary condition :
gcd(x,y) = 2 ^ k


__Sufficient Condition__

Assume gcd(x,y) = 2 ^ k
If x is even, we can go (x / 2, y)
If y is even, we can go (x, y / 2)
If both odd and x < y, we can go (x, (x+y)/2)
If both odd and x > y, we can go ((x+y)/2, y)
(x, y) can continue go smaller,
until (x, y) both odd and x == y,
that is x == y == 1

__Conclusion__

Based on the Necessary Condition and Sufficient Condition,
we conclude that
"(1, 1) can go forward to (x, y)"
equals to
"(x, y) can go back to (1, 1)"
equals
gcd(x,y) is pow of 2.

__Pow of 2__

Many ways to check if x is pow of 2.

__Option 1__

We can continuely divide x by 2 and
check if stops at 1.

__Option 2__

Also we can check x lowbit by x & -x.


__Complexity__

Time O(logX + logY))
Space O(1)
