2551. Put Marbles in Bags

You have `k` bags. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `weights` where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `i`th marble. You are also given the integer `k`.

Divide the marbles into the `k` bags according to the following rules:

* No bag is empty.
* If the `i`th marble and `j`th marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the `i`th and `j`th indices should also be in that same bag.
* If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from `i` to `j` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is `weights[i] + weights[j]`.

The **score** after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the `k` bags.

Return the **difference** between the **maximum** and **minimum** scores among marble distributions.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= weights.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= weights[i] <= 10^9`

__Intuition__

Seems a O(nk) dp problem at the first galance,
when observe the effect of different cut points,
I realize it's more like problem,
to pick k largest/smallest from n numbers.


__Explanation__

First for any of distributions,
we will sum up A[0] and A[n - 1] in the total socre,
so this won't make any difference between max and min.

To split into k bags,
we actually choose k-1 cut points:
A[0]...A[i1]
A[i1+1]....A[i2]
A[i2+1]....A[i3]
....
A[ik+1]....A[n-1]

The result score is:
(A[0] + A[i1]) + (A[i2] + A[i3]) +..... + (A[ik+1] + A[n-1])
equals to
A[0] + (A[i1] + A[i1+1]) + (A[i2] + A[i2+1]) + ....

So the problem turns out to be,
calculate the max/min sum of k - 1 numbers in
A[0] + A[1], A[1] + A[2],..., A[n-1] + A[n].

We can simply sort them in O(sort)
or we can apply a priority queue in O(nlogk).

        vector<int> candidates;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            candidates.push_back(weights[i] + weights[i+1]);
        }
        sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());
        long long mins = 0, maxs = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k-1; i++)
        {
            mins += candidates[i];
            maxs += candidates[n-2-i];
        }
        return maxs - mins;
    }
