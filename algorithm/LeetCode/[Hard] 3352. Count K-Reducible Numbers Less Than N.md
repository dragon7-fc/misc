3352. Count K-Reducible Numbers Less Than N

You are given a binary string `s` representing a number `n` in its binary form.

You are also given an integer `k`.

An integer x is called **k-reducible** if performing the following operation **at most** `k` times reduces it to `1`:

* Replace `x` with the **count** of **set bits** in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of `6` is `"110"`. Applying the operation once reduces it to `2` (since `"110"` has two set bits). Applying the operation again to `2` (binary `"10"`) reduces it to `1` (since `"10"` has one set bit).

Return an integer denoting the number of positive integers less than `n` that are **k-reducible**.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "111", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

n = 7. The 1-reducible integers less than 7 are 1, 2, and 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "1000", k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

n = 8. The 2-reducible integers less than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1", k = 3

Output: 0

Explanation:

There are no positive integers less than n = 1, so the answer is 0.
```
 

Constraints:

* `1 <= s.length <= 800`
* `s` has no leading zeros.
* `s` consists only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.
* `1 <= k <= 5`

**Solution 1: (DP)**

__Intuition__
Given a binary integer s with n bits, for each i in [0, n], we aim to count integers x where x <= s and x has exactly i set bits. We can use DP to track these counts.

To determine if x is k-reducible, we first apply one operation to reduce x to i (the count of its set bits). Then, we check if i is (k - 1)-reducible. This means if i is (k - 1)-reducible, then all values counted in dp[i] are k-reducible, and we can add dp[i] to the final answer.

__Approach__
Define a Reducibility Check Function

Use DP to Count Valid Numbers with a Certain Number of Set Bits:
Set up a DP table where dp[i] tracks the number of binary numbers with exactly i set bits that are less than or equal to the current prefix of s.

For each bit in s (say s[x]):

If s[x] == '1', we can either keep a '0' in this position or add a '1', so dp[i] = prev[i] + prev[i - 1]

If s[x] == '0', we still have the option to add a 0, but adding a 1 could make the number exceed s if prev[i - 1] counts the exact prefix s[0:x-1]. To handle this, we track the count of set bits (cnt) in the prefix s[0:x-1], and if i - 1 == cnt, we subtract one count to exclude the exact match with the prefix.

Thus, our transitions are:

When s[x] == '0' and i - 1 == cnt: dp[i] = prev[i] + (prev[i - 1] - 1)
When s[x] == '0' and i - 1 != cnt: dp[i] = prev[i] + prev[i - 1]

Calculate the Final Count of k-Reducible Numbers:
If i is (k - 1)-reducible, we add dp[i] to answer. Notice that if i == cnt, we need to subtract 1 from dp[i] because the problem wants "strictly smaller" numbers, and s is counted by dp[i]
