3093. Longest Common Suffix Queries

You are given two arrays of strings `wordsContainer` and `wordsQuery`.

For each `wordsQuery[i]`, you need to find a string from `wordsContainer` that has the longest common suffix with `wordsQuery[i]`. If there are two or more strings in `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the **smallest** in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred **earlier** in `wordsContainer`.

Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the index of the string in `wordsContainer` that has the longest common suffix with `wordsQuery[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: wordsContainer = ["abcd","bcd","xbcd"], wordsQuery = ["cd","bcd","xyz"]

Output: [1,1,1]

Explanation:

Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "cd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "cd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[1] = "bcd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "bcd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[2] = "xyz", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is "", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: wordsContainer = ["abcdefgh","poiuygh","ghghgh"], wordsQuery = ["gh","acbfgh","acbfegh"]

Output: [2,0,2]

Explanation:

Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "gh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.
For wordsQuery[1] = "acbfgh", only the string at index 0 shares the longest common suffix "fgh". Hence it is the answer, even though the string at index 2 is shorter.
For wordsQuery[2] = "acbfegh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 10^3`
* `1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 10^3`
* `wordsContainer[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* `wordsQuery[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* Sum of `wordsContainer[i].length` is at most `5 * 10^5`.
* Sum of `wordsQuery[i].length` is at most `5 * 10^5`.
