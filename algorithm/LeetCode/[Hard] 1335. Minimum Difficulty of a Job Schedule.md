1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i`-th job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i`-th job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

![1335_untitled.png](img/1335_untitled.png)
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
Output: 15
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
Output: 843
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
* `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= d <= 10`

**Solution 1: (DP Top-Down)**

**Explanation**

* `dfs` help find the the minimum difficulty
if start work at ith job with `d` days left.

* If `d = 1`, only one day left, we have to do all jobs,
return the maximum difficulty of jobs.


**Complexity**

* Time O(nnd)
* Space O(nd)
