3426. Manhattan Distances of All Arrangements of Pieces

You are given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`.

There is a rectangular grid of size `m Ã— n` containing `k` identical pieces. Return the sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all **valid arrangements** of pieces.

A **valid arrangement** is a placement of all k pieces on the grid with **at most** one piece per cell.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, k = 2

Output: 8

Explanation:

The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:
```

```
In the first 4 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 1.
In the last 2 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 2.
Thus, the total Manhattan distance across all valid arrangements is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 1, n = 4, k = 3

Output: 20

Explanation:

The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:
```
![3426_4040example2drawio.png](img/3426_4040example2drawio.png)
```
The first and last arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
The middle two arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The total Manhattan distance between all pairs of pieces across all arrangements is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.

**Solution 1: (Combination)**

__Explanation__
Consider the contribution of distance from two different rows:

If the distance of rows is d = 1,
there are m - 1 combination: (0,1),(1,2) ...
If the distance of rows is d = 2,
there are m - 2 combination: (0,2),(1,3) ...
For distance d, there are m - d combinations.

For each combination of (xi, xj) above,
the yi has n options,
yj has n options,
the rest of points has comb(m - n - 2, k - 2) combinations.

Same process for contribution from two different cols.
