3113. Find the Number of Subarrays Where Boundary Elements Are Maximum

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

Return the number of **subarrays**  of `nums,` where the first and the last elements of the subarray are equal to the **largest** element in the subarray.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2]

Output: 6

Explanation:

There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 4. The first element is 4 and the last element is also 4.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 2. The first element is 2 and the last element is also 2.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
Hence, we return 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,3,3]

Output: 6

Explanation:

There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
Hence, we return 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

There is a single subarray of nums which is [1], with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.

Hence, we return 1.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
