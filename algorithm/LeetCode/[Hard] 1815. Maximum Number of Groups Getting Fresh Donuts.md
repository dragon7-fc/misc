1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts

There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have a rule where they must serve **all** of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of `groups[i] `customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.

You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return the **maximum** possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can arrange the groups as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Then the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th groups will be happy.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= batchSize <= 9`
* `1 <= groups.length <= 30`
* `1 <= groups[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (NP Problem With Optimization)**

This is a NP hard problem, so eventually, we will have to brute force the solution.

But before that, there is a few quick observations that we can optimize:

1. We only need to consider the mod remainder for each group.
1. If the size of the group is the multiple of the batchSize (or the remainder is 0), then we can serve them first since they can be easily satisfied. ie. if the batch size is 9 and a group is 27, then we can surve them first.
1. For the remaining of the groups, if two groups are complement of each other. ie. if the batch size is 9, and the two groups have remainder of 5 and 4, then we know we can only satisfy one of the two.

With the above three filterings, the remaining groups are very small and can be easily brute forced and very fast.
