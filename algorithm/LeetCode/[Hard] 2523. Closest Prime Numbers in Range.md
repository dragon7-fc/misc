2523. Closest Prime Numbers in Range

Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find the two integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

* `left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right` .
* `nums1` and `nums2` are both **prime** numbers.
* `nums2 - nums1` is the **minimum** amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.

Return the positive integer array `ans = [nums1, nums2]`. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum `nums1` value or `[-1, -1]` if such numbers do not exist.

A number greater than `1` is called **prime** if it is only divisible by `1` and itself.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11,13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: left = 4, right = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= left <= right <= 10^6`
