1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits

You are given a string `time` in the form of `hh:mm`, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by `?`).

The valid times are those inclusively between `00:00` and `23:59`.

Return the latest valid time you can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: time = "2?:?0"
Output: "23:50"
Explanation: The latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: time = "0?:3?"
Output: "09:39"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: time = "1?:22"
Output: "19:22"
```

**Constraints:**

* `time` is in the format `hh:mm`.
* It is guaranteed that you can produce a valid time from the given string.
