1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:

* Change the rightmost ($0^{th}$) bit in the binary representation of n.
* Change the $i^{th}$ bit in the binary representation of `n` if the $(i-1)^{th}$ bit is set to `1` and the $(i-2)^{th}$ through $0^{th}$ bits are set to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 9
Output: 14
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 333
Output: 393
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 109`

**Solution 1: (Bit Manipulation)**

**Intuition**

For 1XXXXXXX,
we need to transfer it
1XXXXXXX -> 11000000 -> 10000000 -> 0


**Observation 1**

The two operations are undo-able.
If a -> b needs k operation,
b -> a also needs k operation.


**Observation 2**

1 -> 0 needs 1 operation,
2 -> 0 needs 3 operations,
4 -> 0 needs 7 operations,
2^k needs 2^(k+1)-1 operations.

This can be easily proved.


**Solution 1: Recursion**

1XXXXXX -> 1100000 -> 100000 -> 0

1XXXXXX -> 1100000 needs minimumOneBitOperations(1XXXXXX ^ 1100000),
because it needs same operations 1XXXXXX ^ 1100000 -> 1100000 ^ 1100000 = 0.

1100000 -> 100000 needs 1 operation.
100000 -> 0, where 100000 is 2^k, needs 2^(k-1) - 1 operations.

In total,
f(n) = f((b >> 1) ^ b ^ n) + 1 + b - 1,
where b is the maximum power of 2 that small or equals to n.

* Time O(logn)
* Space O(logn)
