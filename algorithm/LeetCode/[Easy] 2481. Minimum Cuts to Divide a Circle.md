2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle

A valid cut in a circle can be:

* A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
* A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.

Given the integer `n`, return the **minimum** number of cuts needed to divide a circle into `n` equal slices.

 

**Example 1:**

![2481_11drawio.png](img/2481_11drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.
```

**Example 2:**

![2481_22drawio.png](img/2481_22drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
At least 3 cuts are needed to divide the circle into 3 equal slices. 
It can be shown that less than 3 cuts cannot result in 3 slices of equal size and shape.
Also note that the first cut will not divide the circle into distinct parts.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
