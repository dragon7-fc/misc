3435. Frequencies of Shortest Supersequences

You are given an array of strings `words`. Find all **shortest common supersequences (SCS)** of `words` that are not **permutations** of each other.

A **shortest common supersequence** is a string of **minimum** length that contains each string in `words` as a **subsequence**.

Return a 2D array of integers `freqs` that represent all the SCSs. Each `freqs[i]` is an array of size 26, representing the frequency of each letter in the lowercase English alphabet for a single SCS. You may return the frequency arrays in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["ab","ba"]

Output: [[1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Explanation:

The two SCSs are "aba" and "bab". The output is the letter frequencies for each one.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["aa","ac"]

Output: [[2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Explanation:

The two SCSs are "aac" and "aca". Since they are permutations of each other, keep only "aac".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["aa","bb","cc"]

Output: [[2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Explanation:

"aabbcc" and all its permutations are SCSs.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 256`
* `words[i].length == 2`
* All strings in `words` will altogether be composed of no more than 16 unique lowercase letters.
* All strings in `words` are unique.

**Solution 1: (Graph)**

__Intuition__
We want a minimal string that contains every 2‑letter word as a subsequence. If a word is “xx”, that letter must appear at least twice. If a word is “xy”, we need “x” to appear somewhere before “y”. This translates into a directed graph among the letters. Whenever there is a directed cycle among letters, at least one letter must be repeated to “break” that cycle in a single linear arrangement. In particular, for any 2‑cycle “x <-> y”, we must have at least two occurrences of either x or y. More generally, for bigger cycles of length ≥ 2, repeating at least one letter in that cycle is mandatory.

__Approach__
Extract Letters & Build Graph

Identify each unique letter (at most 16).
Mark self‑loops (letter “xx”).
Build adjacency (hasEdge[x][y] = true if x->y in some word “xy”).
Base Frequencies & 2‑cycles

For each letter with a self‑loop “xx”, set baseFreq[x] = 2; otherwise baseFreq[x] = 1.
For each 2‑cycle (x <-> y), either freq[x] ≥ 2 or freq[y] ≥ 2.
Cycle Detection on Single‑Occur Subgraph

We use a bitmask to choose which letters get one extra occurrence (i.e. freq[x] = baseFreq[x] + 1).
If a letter’s frequency is 2 by default, we consider it always “repeated” and exclude it from the single‑occurrence subgraph.
The letters that remain at exactly one occurrence must not form any directed cycle among themselves.
Enumerate All Bitmask Choices

For each subset of letters chosen to repeat, check:
(a) 2‑cycle constraints (x<->y must hold for each pair).
(b) The subgraph of single‑occurrence letters is acyclic.
Keep track of those configurations with the minimal sum of frequencies.
Build Answers

For each valid configuration matching the minimum total length, create a 26‑element frequency array showing how many times each letter appears. These frequency arrays represent all minimal supersequences up to permutation.
__Complexity__
Time Complexity:
We consider at most 2^k bitmask configurations (k ≤ 16).
For each subset, we check 2‑cycle constraints in O(k^2) and do a DFS cycle check also in O(k^2).
Total is roughly O(k^2 * 2^k).
Space Complexity:
O(k^2) for the adjacency and O(2^k) for storing potential valid masks.
