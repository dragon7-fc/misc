3579. Minimum Steps to Convert String with Operations

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, of equal length. You need to transform `word1` into `word2`.

For this, divide `word1` into one or more contiguous substrings. For each substring `substr` you can perform the following operations:

* **Replace**: Replace the character at any one index of `substr` with another lowercase English letter.

* **Swap**: Swap any two characters in `substr`.

* **Reverse Substring**: Reverse `substr`.

Each of these counts as one operation and each character of each substring can be used in each type of operation at most once (i.e. no single index may be involved in more than one replace, one swap, or one reverse).

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to transform `word1` into `word2`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "abcdf", word2 = "dacbe"

Output: 4

Explanation:

Divide word1 into "ab", "c", and "df". The operations are:

For the substring "ab",
Perform operation of type 3 on "ab" -> "ba".
Perform operation of type 1 on "ba" -> "da".
For the substring "c" do no operations.
For the substring "df",
Perform operation of type 1 on "df" -> "bf".
Perform operation of type 1 on "bf" -> "be".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "abceded", word2 = "baecfef"

Output: 4

Explanation:

Divide word1 into "ab", "ce", and "ded". The operations are:

For the substring "ab",
Perform operation of type 2 on "ab" -> "ba".
For the substring "ce",
Perform operation of type 2 on "ce" -> "ec".
For the substring "ded",
Perform operation of type 1 on "ded" -> "fed".
Perform operation of type 1 on "fed" -> "fef".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word1 = "abcdef", word2 = "fedabc"

Output: 2

Explanation:

Divide word1 into "abcdef". The operations are:

For the substring "abcdef",
Perform operation of type 3 on "abcdef" -> "fedcba".
Perform operation of type 2 on "fedcba" -> "fedabc".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length == word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (DP)**

__Intuition__
DP to try all substrings.

__Explanation__
We use dynamic programming (dp[i]) to store the minimum operations needed to convert the first i characters of s1 to match s2.

For each substring s1[i..j], you check how many operations it takes to make it equal to s2[i..j], either directly or by reversing it once.

The test() function matches characters using swaps where possible, and otherwise counts needed replacements.

We try all substring splits, and pick the one with the minimum total cost.

__Complexity__
Time O(n^3)
Space O(n)

        def sub(s1, s2):
            def test(s1, s2):
                res = 0
                count = Counter()
                for a, b in zip(s1, s2):
                    if a == b: continue
                    if count[(b, a)]:
                        count[(b, a)] -= 1
                    else:
                        count[(a, b)] += 1
                        res += 1
                return res
            return min(test(s1, s2), test(s1, s2[::-1]) + 1)

        n = len(word1)
        dp = [0] + [inf] * n
        for j in range(n):
            for i in range(j + 1):
                dp[j + 1] = min(dp[j + 1], dp[i] + sub(word1[i:j+1], word2[i:j+1]))
        return dp[-1]
