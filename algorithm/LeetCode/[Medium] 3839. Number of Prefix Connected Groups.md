3839. Number of Prefix Connected Groups

You are given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`.

Two words `a` and `b` at distinct indices are **prefix-connected** if `a[0..k-1] == b[0..k-1]`.

A **connected group** is a set of words such that each pair of words is **prefix-connected**.

Return the number of **connected groups** that contain **at least** two words, formed from the given words.

Note:

Words with length less than k cannot join any group and are ignored.
Duplicate strings are treated as separate words.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["apple","apply","banana","bandit"], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

Words sharing the same first k = 2 letters are grouped together:

words[0] = "apple" and words[1] = "apply" share prefix "ap".
words[2] = "banana" and words[3] = "bandit" share prefix "ba".
Thus, there are 2 connected groups, each containing at least two words.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["car","cat","cartoon"], k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

Words are evaluated for a prefix of length k = 3:

words[0] = "car" and words[2] = "cartoon" share prefix "car".
words[1] = "cat" does not share a 3-length prefix with any other word.
Thus, there is 1 connected group.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["bat","dog","dog","doggy","bat"], k = 3

Output: 2

Explanation:

Words are evaluated for a prefix of length k = 3:

words[0] = "bat" and words[4] = "bat" form a group.
words[1] = "dog", words[2] = "dog" and words[3] = "doggy" share prefix "dog".
Thus, there are 2 connected groups, each containing at least two words.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 100`
* All strings in `words` consist of lowercase English letters.
