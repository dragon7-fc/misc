1307. Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle

Given an equation, represented by `words` on left side and the `result` on right side.

You need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:

* Each character is decoded as one digit `(0 - 9)`.
* Every pair of different characters they must map to different digits.
* Each `words[i]` and `result` are decoded as one number without leading zeros.
* Sum of numbers on left side (`words`) will equal to the number on right side (`result`). 

Return `True` if the equation is solvable otherwise return `False`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["SEND","MORE"], result = "MONEY"
Output: true
Explanation: Map 'S'-> 9, 'E'->5, 'N'->6, 'D'->7, 'M'->1, 'O'->0, 'R'->8, 'Y'->'2'
Such that: "SEND" + "MORE" = "MONEY" ,  9567 + 1085 = 10652
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["SIX","SEVEN","SEVEN"], result = "TWENTY"
Output: true
Explanation: Map 'S'-> 6, 'I'->5, 'X'->0, 'E'->8, 'V'->7, 'N'->2, 'T'->1, 'W'->'3', 'Y'->4
Such that: "SIX" + "SEVEN" + "SEVEN" = "TWENTY" ,  650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["THIS","IS","TOO"], result = "FUNNY"
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: words = ["LEET","CODE"], result = "POINT"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= words.length <= 5`
* `1 <= words[i].length, results.length <= 7`
* `words[i]`, `result` contains only upper case English letters.
* Number of different characters used on the expression is at most `10`.

**Solution 1: (Backtracking)**

* The idea is to use backtracking to try all possible values column wise.
* We go column by column and for each column we go row by row and start assigning values.
* In my progrram `solve(i, j, carry)` => `i` represents which column for this iteration and `j` represents which word in the current iteration we are trying to assign values.

With this structure the remaining part is simply to assign values to all the word characters of a particular column from the unassigned set of (`0 - 9`) and if the column assignment is over, we check if the summation of that column holds true by comparing with the corresponding character in the Result (if that char in result is already assigned, or else we assign the current sum value to the corresponding char in result). Then we proceed to the next column, starting with word 0.

Couple of things to take care of;
*  careful not to assign 0 for the first letter of a word
*  when trying to assign a particular column of a particular word, make sure that word is long enough.
