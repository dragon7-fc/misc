1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones

You are given an integer array, `nums`, and an integer `k`. `nums` comprises of only `0`'s and `1`'s. In one move, you can choose two **adjacent** indices and swap their values.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required so that nums has `k` **consecutive** `1`'s.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: In 1 move, nums could be [1,0,0,0,1,1] and have 2 consecutive 1's.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: In 5 moves, the leftmost 1 can be shifted right until nums = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: nums already has 2 consecutive 1's.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `nums[i] is 0 or 1`.
* `1 <= k <= sum(nums)`

**Solution 1: (Bit Manipulations)**

**Short Explanation**

Find all index of nums[i] if nums[i] == 1.
Now the problem changes to,
find k consecute element in A,
that has minimum distance to their median sequence.
To solve this, we need to use the prefix sum of A,
which is B in this solution.


**Complexity**

* Time O(n)
* Space O(n)

            B[i + 1] = B[i] + A[i]
        for i in range(len(A) - k + 1):
            res = min(res, B[i + k] - B[k // 2 + i] - B[(k + 1) // 2 + i] + B[i])
        res -= (k // 2) * ((k + 1) // 2)
        return res
