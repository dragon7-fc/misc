3145. Find Products of Elements of Big Array

A **powerful array** for an integer `x` is the shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to `x`. For example, the powerful array for `11` is `[1, 2, 8]`.

The array `big_nums` is created by concatenating the **powerful** arrays for every positive integer `i` in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, and so forth. Thus, `big_nums` starts as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...]`.

You are given a 2D integer matrix `queries`, where for `queries[i] = [fromi, toi, modi]` you should calculate `(big_nums[fromi] * big_nums[fromi + 1] * ... * big_nums[toi]) % modi`.

Return an integer array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: queries = [[1,3,7]]

Output: [4]

Explanation:

There is one query.

big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. The product of them is 4. The remainder of 4 under 7 is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: queries = [[2,5,3],[7,7,4]]

Output: [2,2]

Explanation:

There are two queries.

First query: big_nums[2..5] = [1,2,4,1]. The product of them is 8. The remainder of 8 under 3 is 2.

Second query: big_nums[7] = 2. The remainder of 2 under 4 is 2.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
* `queries[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= 10^15`
* `1 <= queries[i][2] <= 10^5`

__Explanation__
count(x) returns the sum of bits from 1 to x.
mul(x) returns the pow of product of powerful arrays from 1 to x.
query(k) returns the pow of product of k first integers in big_nums.


__Complexity__
