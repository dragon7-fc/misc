1037. Valid Boomerang

A boomerang is a set of 3 points that are all distinct and **not** in a straight line.

Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
```

**Note:**

* `points.length == 3`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= points[i][j] <= 100`
