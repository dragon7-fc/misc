3594. Minimum Time to Transport All Individuals

You are given n individuals at a base camp who need to cross a river to reach a destination using a single boat. The boat can carry at most `k` people at a time. The trip is affected by environmental conditions that vary **cyclically** over m stages.

Each stage `j` has a speed multiplier `mul[j]`:

* If `mul[j] > 1`, the trip slows down.
* If `mul[j] < 1`, the trip speeds up.

Each individual `i` has a rowing strength represented by `time[i]`, the time (in minutes) it takes them to cross alone in neutral conditions.

***Rules*:

* A group g departing at stage `j` takes time equal to the maximum time[i] among its members, multiplied by `mul[j]` minutes to reach the destination.
* After the group crosses the river in time `d`, the stage advances by `floor(d) % m` steps.
* If individuals are left behind, one person must return with the boat. Let r be the index of the returning person, the return takes `time[r] × mul[current_stage]`, defined as `return_time`, and the stage advances by `floor(return_time) % m`.

Return the **minimum** total time required to transport all individuals. If it is not possible to transport all individuals to the destination, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1, k = 1, m = 2, time = [5], mul = [1.0,1.3]

Output: 5.00000

Explanation:

Individual 0 departs from stage 0, so crossing time = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes.
All team members are now at the destination. Thus, the total time taken is 5.00 minutes.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 2, m = 3, time = [2,5,8], mul = [1.0,1.5,0.75]

Output: 14.50000

Explanation:

The optimal strategy is:

Send individuals 0 and 2 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 8) × mul[0] = 8 × 1.00 = 8.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(8.00) % 3 = 2, so the next stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2.
Individual 0 returns alone from the destination to the base camp from stage 2. The return time is 2 × mul[2] = 2 × 0.75 = 1.50 minutes. The stage advances by floor(1.50) % 3 = 1, so the next stage is (2 + 1) % 3 = 0.
Send individuals 0 and 1 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 5) × mul[0] = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(5.00) % 3 = 2, so the final stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2.
All team members are now at the destination. The total time taken is 8.00 + 1.50 + 5.00 = 14.50 minutes.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 2, k = 1, m = 2, time = [10,10], mul = [2.0,2.0]

Output: -1.00000

Explanation:

Since the boat can only carry one person at a time, it is impossible to transport both individuals as one must always return. Thus, the answer is -1.00.
```

**onstraints:**

* `1 <= n == time.length <= 12`
* `1 <= k <= 5`
* `1 <= m <= 5`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 100`
* `m == mul.length`
* `0.5 <= mul[i] <= 2.0`

**Solution 1: (Dijkstra + Bitmask)**

🙌 TLDR
This is a bitmask + Dijkstra simulation over state space.
It accounts for stage progression based on floor(time) and handles asymmetric transitions (group cross, single return).

DP State
We use a priority queue (heap) to simulate all possible crossing states, always expanding the path with the least total time first (similar to Dijkstra).

Each state is defined as a tuple (t, p, mask, j):

t: current time.
p: boat position (0 = camp, 1 = destination).
mask: bitmask of people already at the destination.
j: current stage index.
We use a visited map seen[(p, mask, j)] = t
to avoid revisiting worse states.

🔁 Transitions
From camp (p == 0):
Try sending every group of size 1 to k to the other side.

From destination (p == 1):
Try returning each person (individually) to bring the boat back.

Each time we cross or return, we update the stage index:
new_j = (j + floor(time_taken)) % m

Termination
If all n people are on the destination side and the boat is also there
(mask == (1 << n) - 1 and p == 1)
return the current time rounded to 5 decimals.
If the queue is exhausted without achieving that, return -1.0.

⏱️ Complexity
Time: O(2^n * m * 2), pruned heavily due to Dijkstra and seen map.
Space: O(2^n * m * 2) for visited state space.
