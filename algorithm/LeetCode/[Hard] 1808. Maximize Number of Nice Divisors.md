1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are asked to construct a positive integer `n` that satisfies the following conditions:

* The number of prime factors of `n` (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.
* The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.

Return the number of nice divisors of `n`. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number `n` is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals `n`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: primeFactors = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: primeFactors = 8
Output: 18
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= primeFactors <= 109`

**Solution 1: (Mqth)**

In fact, this problem is very similar to problem 343. Integer Break https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/, let me explain why:

Imagine, that we have number m = p1^a1*p2^a2*...*pk^ak, this is standard representation of number, where p1, ..., pk are some prime numbers and a1, ..., ak some integer powers. Then total number of nice divisors can be calculated by a1*...*ak: just using combinatorics rules: first one can be choosen by a1 options, second by a2 and so on. Also, we are given, that a1 + ... + ak <= n, where by n here I defined primeFactors for simplicity. So, the problem now looks like:

Given a1 + ... + ak <= n find maximum a1 * ... ak.

Let us prove, that it is always better when we make numbers equal to 2 or 3. Indeed, if we have bigger, we can split it to two parts: like 4 -> 2*2, 5 -> 2*3, 6 -> 3*3 and so on. Moreover, if we have 2, 2, 2, it is always better to replace it to 3, 3. So in the end: optimal configuration has only 2 and 3 and number of 2 is not more than two. Let us just check all 3 cases: n gives reminders 0, 1, 2 when divided by 3 and evaluate answer.

Complexity: time complexity is O(log n), because function pow with given modulo M will use expontiation trick with doubling of exponent. Space complexity is O(1).

    def maxNiceDivisors(self, primeFactors: int) -> int:
        M = 10**9 + 7
        if primeFactors <= 3: return primeFactors
        if primeFactors % 3 == 0: return pow(3, primeFactors//3, M)
        if primeFactors % 3 == 1: return (pow(3, (primeFactors-4)//3, M) * 4) % M
        return (2*pow(3, primeFactors//3, M)) % M
