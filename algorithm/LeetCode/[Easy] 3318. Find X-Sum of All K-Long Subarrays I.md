3318. Find X-Sum of All K-Long Subarrays I

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and two integers `k` and `x`.

The **x-sum** of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

* Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
* Keep only the occurrences of the top `x` most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the **bigger** value is considered more frequent.
* Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

**Note** that if an array has less than `x` distinct elements, its **x-sum** is the sum of the array.

Return an integer array `answer` of length `n - k + 1` where `answer[i]` is the **x-sum** of the **subarray**  `nums[i..i + k - 1]`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2

Output: [6,10,12]

Explanation:

For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.
For subarray [2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3], only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2

Output: [11,15,15,15,12]

Explanation:

Since k == x, answer[i] is equal to the sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 50`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
* `1 <= x <= k <= nums.length`
