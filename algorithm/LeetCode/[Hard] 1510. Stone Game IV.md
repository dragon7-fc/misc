1510. Stone Game IV

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`

**Hint:**

Use dynamic programming to keep track of winning and losing states. Given some number of stones, Alice can win if she can force Bob onto a losing state.

                else:
                    break
        return dp[n]
```

**Solution 4: (DP Bottom-Up)**

**Explanation**

`dp[i]` means the result for n = i.

if there is any `k` that `dp[i - k * k] == false`,
it means we can make the other lose the game,
so we can win the game an `dp[i] = true`.


**Complexity**

* Time `O(n^1.5)`
* Space `O(N)`

            dp[i] = not all(dp[i - k * k] for k in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1))
        return dp[-1]

            for (int k = 1; k * k <= i; ++k) {
                if (!dp[i - k * k]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

**Solution 6: (DP Bottom-Up)**

* First, calculate the possible moves (squares), then check if alice wins.
* Alice wins when at least one of her moves always wins, consequently Bob loses when all of his counter-moves lose.
