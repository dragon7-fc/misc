1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges

There are `n` oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:

* Eat one orange.
* If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by `2` then you can eat  `n/2` oranges.
* If the number of remaining oranges (`n`) is divisible by `3` then you can eat  `2*(n/3)` oranges.

You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Return the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: You have 10 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.  
Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. 
Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: You have 6 oranges.
Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2).
Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3)
Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0.
You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 56
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2*10^9`

**Solution 1: (DP Top-Down)**

**Intuition**

As pleasant as it seems, it does not make sense to eat oranges one by one.

So, the choice we have is to eat n % 2 oranges one-by-one and then swallow n / 2, or eat n % 3 oranges so that we can gobble 2 * n / 3.

As usual, we use DP to avoid re-computation. Since our numbers can be large, it's better to use a hash map instead of an array.

        return dp[n];
    }
};
