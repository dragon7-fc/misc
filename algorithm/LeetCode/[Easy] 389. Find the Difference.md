389. Find the Difference

Given two strings **s** and **t** which consist of only lowercase letters.

String **t** is generated by random shuffling string **s** and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in **t**.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
