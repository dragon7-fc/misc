3248. Snake in Matrix

There is a snake in an `n x n` matrix `grid` and can move in four possible directions. Each cell in the grid is identified by the position: `grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j`.

The snake starts at cell `0` and follows a sequence of commands.

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of the grid and an array of strings `commands` where each `command[i]` is either `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the `grid` boundaries throughout its movement.

Return the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing `commands`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, commands = ["RIGHT","DOWN"]

Output: 3

Explanation:

0	1
2	3
0	1
2	3
0	1
2	3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, commands = ["DOWN","RIGHT","UP"]

Output: 1

Explanation:

0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8
0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8
0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8
0	1	2
3	4	5
6	7	8
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10`
* `1 <= commands.length <= 100`
* `commands` consists only of `"UP"`, `"RIGHT"`, `"DOWN"`, and `"LEFT"`.
* The input is generated such the snake will not move outside of the boundaries.
