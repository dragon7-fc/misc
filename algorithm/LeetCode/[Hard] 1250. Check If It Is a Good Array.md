1250. Check If It Is a Good Array

Given an array `nums` of positive integers. Your task is to select some subset of `nums`, multiply each element by an integer and add all these numbers. The array is said to be good if you can obtain a sum of `1` from the array by any possible subset and multiplicand.

Return `True` if the array is good otherwise return `False`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [12,5,7,23]
Output: true
Explanation: Pick numbers 5 and 7.
5*3 + 7*(-2) = 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [29,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: Pick numbers 29, 6 and 10.
29*1 + 6*(-3) + 10*(-1) = 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,6]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1:**

Hcf means the highest common factor from 0 to the current index. If hcf is k(k > 1), which means for all the elements from index 0 to i, they could all be divided by k. So we cannot get a value smaller than k by multiplying integer and adding them. If k == 1, we must find a chain which could get two integers from different values in nums[] and the two integers are coprime. Then we can get the result 1 we want.
