1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can choose two indices `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length` and do the assignment `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`.

If there is no way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [4,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Replace 5 with 3 and then replace 3 with 4. arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,6,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: You can't make arr1 strictly increasing.
``` 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 2000`
* `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (DP Top-Down)**

For each element in `arr1`, you can either choose to swap it or not swap it with some element in `arr2`.

* If you swap it, you need to pick up the smallest element in `arr2` that is bigger than the previous element in `arr1`. If no such element in `arr2`, you can't swap
* If you don't swap it, you need to make sure current element in `arr1` is bigger than previous element in `arr1`. Otherwise you have to swap it.

`dfs(i, prev)`: `"i"` represents index in `arr1`. `"prev"` represents the previous element in `arr1` after swap (or maybe not swap). It returns the minimal changes required to make `0~i` of `arr1` increasing.

            noswap = dfs(i+1, arr1[i]) if arr1[i] > prev else float('inf')
            return min(swap,noswap)
        
        changes = dfs(0, float('-inf'))
        return changes if changes != float('inf') else -1
