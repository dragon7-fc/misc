3751. Total Waviness of Numbers in Range I

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2` representing an inclusive range `[num1, num2]`.

The **waviness** of a number is defined as the total count of its **peaks** and **valleys**:

* A digit is a **peak** if it is **strictly greater** than both of its immediate neighbors.
* A digit is a **valley** if it is **strictly less** than both of its immediate neighbors.
* The first and last digits of a number **cannot** be peaks or valleys.
* Any number with fewer than 3 digits has a waviness of 0.

Return the total sum of waviness for all numbers in the range [num1, num2].
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num1 = 120, num2 = 130

Output: 3

Explanation:

In the range [120, 130]:
120: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
121: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
130: middle digit 3 is a peak, waviness = 1.
All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.
Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num1 = 198, num2 = 202

Output: 3

Explanation:

In the range [198, 202]:
198: middle digit 9 is a peak, waviness = 1.
201: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
202: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.
Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num1 = 4848, num2 = 4848

Output: 2

Explanation:

Number 4848: the second digit 8 is a peak, and the third digit 4 is a valley, giving a waviness of 2.
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= num1 <= num2 <= 10^5`
