27. Remove Element

Given an array `nums` and a value `val`, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Summary
This is a pretty easy problem, but one may get confused by the term "in-place" and think it is impossible to remove an element from the array without making a copy of the array.

Hints
1. Try two pointers.
1. Did you use the fact that the order of elements can be changed?
1. What happens when the elements to remove are rare?

## Approach 1: Two Pointers
**Intuition**

Since this question is asking us to remove all elements of the given value in-place, we have to handle it with $O(1)$ extra space. How to solve it? We can keep two pointers $i$ and $j$, where $i$ is the slow-runner while $j$ is the fast-runner.

Algorithm

When $nums[j]$ equals to the given value, skip this element by incrementing jj. As long as $nums[j] \neq valnums[j]$, we copy $nums[j]$ to $nums[i]$ and increment both indexes at the same time. Repeat the process until $j$ reaches the end of the array and the new length is ii.

This solution is very similar to the solution to Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.
```java
public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
    int i = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != val) {
            nums[i] = nums[j];
            i++;
        }
    }
    return i;
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $O(n)$. Assume the array has a total of $n$ elements, both $i$ and $j$ traverse at most 2n2n steps.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$.

## Approach 2: Two Pointers - when elements to remove are rare
**Intuition**

Now consider cases where the array contains few elements to remove. For example, $nums = [1,2,3,5,4], val = 4$. The previous algorithm will do unnecessary copy operation of the first four elements. Another example is $nums = [4,1,2,3,5], val = 4$. It seems unnecessary to move elements $[1,2,3,5]$ one step left as the problem description mentions that the order of elements could be changed.

**Algorithm**

When we encounter $nums[i] = val$, we can swap the current element out with the last element and dispose the last one. This essentially reduces the array's size by 1.

Note that the last element that was swapped in could be the value you want to remove itself. But don't worry, in the next iteration we will still check this element.

```java
public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
    int i = 0;
    int n = nums.length;
    while (i < n) {
        if (nums[i] == val) {
            nums[i] = nums[n - 1];
            // reduce array size by one
            n--;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    return n;
}
```
