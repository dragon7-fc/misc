2068. Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent

Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered **almost equivalent** if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is **at most** `3`.

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `true` if word1 and word2 are **almost equivalent**, or `false` otherwise.

The **frequency** of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "aaaa", word2 = "bccb"
Output: false
Explanation: There are 4 'a's in "aaaa" but 0 'a's in "bccb".
The difference is 4, which is more than the allowed 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "abcdeef", word2 = "abaaacc"
Output: true
Explanation: The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 1 time in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'b' appears 1 time in word1 and 1 time in word2. The difference is 0.
- 'c' appears 1 time in word1 and 2 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'd' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.
- 'e' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'f' appears 1 time in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word1 = "cccddabba", word2 = "babababab"
Output: true
Explanation: The differences between the frequencies of each letter in word1 and word2 are at most 3:
- 'a' appears 2 times in word1 and 4 times in word2. The difference is 2.
- 'b' appears 2 times in word1 and 5 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'c' appears 3 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 3.
- 'd' appears 2 times in word1 and 0 times in word2. The difference is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == word1.length == word2.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
