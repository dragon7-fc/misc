2659. Make Array Empty

You are given an integer array `nums` containing distinct numbers, and you can perform the following operations until the array is empty:

* If the first element has the **smallest** value, remove it
* Otherwise, put the first element at the **end** of the array.

Return an integer denoting the number of operations it takes to make `nums` empty.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,-1]
Output: 5
Operation	Array
1	[4, -1, 3]
2	[-1, 3, 4]
3	[3, 4]
4	[4]
5	[]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,3]
Output: 5
Operation	Array
1	[2, 4, 3]
2	[4, 3]
3	[3, 4]
4	[4]
5	[]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Operation	Array
1	[2, 3]
2	[3]
3	[]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* All values in `nums` are distinct.

**Solution 1: (Count Rotation)**

We sort the indexes of the numbers.

For example, for [8, 6, 11, 1, 2, 3, 7], the sorted indexes will be [3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 0, 2].


1. For the test case [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], we need five operations.
2. For [50, 40, 30, 20, 10], we need to first rotate 4 elements to reach the smallest number 10.
    * So we need 5 operations to remove the smallest element, 4 - for the second smallest one, and so on;
    * Total 5 + 10 operations.
3. For [50, 20, 30, 40, 10], we need to rotate 4 elemets to reach 10, 1 element to reach 20.
    * No rotations are needed to reach 30 and 40.
    * Total 5 + 5 operations.
4. For [10, 30, 50, 20, 40], we need:
    * 2 rotations to reach 20, 1 rotations 30, 1 rotation to reach 40.
    * Total 5 + 4 operations.

The sorted index array for the last case is [0, 3, 1, 4, 2].

            if (ids[i] < ids[i - 1])
                res += sz - i;
        return res + sz;
    }
