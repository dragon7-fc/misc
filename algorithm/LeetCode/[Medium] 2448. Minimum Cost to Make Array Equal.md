2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal

You are given two **0-indexed** array `nums` and `cost` consisting each of `n` **positive** integers.

You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

* Increase or decrease **any** element of the array `nums` by `1`.
The cost of doing one operation on the `i`th element is `cost[i]`.

Return the **minimum** total cost such that all the elements of the array `nums` become **equal**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,3,1,14]
Output: 8
Explanation: We can make all the elements equal to 2 in the following way:
- Increase the 0th element one time. The cost is 2.
- Decrease the 1st element one time. The cost is 3.
- Decrease the 2nd element three times. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array equal with a smaller cost.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], cost = [4,2,8,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length == cost.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 10^6`
