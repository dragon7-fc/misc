1575. Count All Possible Routes

You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers `locations` where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j != i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of x.

Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return the count of all possible routes from `start` to `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40
Output: 615088286
Explanation: The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= locations.length <= 100`
* `1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9`
* All integers in locations are distinct.
* `0 <= start, finish < locations.length`
* `1 <= fuel <= 200`
