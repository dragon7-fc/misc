856. Score of Parentheses

Given a balanced parentheses string `S`, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

* `()` has score `1`
* `AB` has score `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings.
* `(A)` has score `2 * A`, where `A` is a balanced parentheses string.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "()"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: "(())"
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: "()()"
Output: 2
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6
```

**Note:**

1. `S` is a balanced parentheses string, containing only `(` and `)`.
1. `2 <= S.length <= 50`

# Solution
---
## Approach 1: Divide and Conquer
**Intuition**

Split the string into `S = A + B` where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings, and `A` is the smallest possible non-empty prefix of `S`.

**Algorithm**

Call a balanced string primitive if it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty balanced strings.

By keeping track of balance (the number of ( parentheses minus the number of ) parentheses), we can partition `S` into primitive substrings `S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n`. Then, `score(S) = score(P_1) + score(P_2) + ... + score(P_n)`, by definition.

For each primitive substring `(S[i], S[i+1], ..., S[k])`, if the string is length `2`, then the score of this string is `1`. Otherwise, it's twice the score of the substring `(S[i+1], S[i+2], ..., S[k-1])`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, S):
        def F(i, j):
            #Score of balanced string S[i:j]
            ans = bal = 0

            #Split string into primitives
            for k in xrange(i, j):
                bal += 1 if S[k] == '(' else -1
                if bal == 0:
                    if k - i == 1:
                        ans += 1
                    else:
                        ans += 2 * F(i+1, k)
                    i = k+1

            return ans

        return F(0, len(S))
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the length of `S`. An example worst case is `(((((((....)))))))`.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, the size of the implied call stack.

## Approach 2: Stack
**Intuition and Algorithm**

Every position in the string has a depth - some number of matching parentheses surrounding it. For example, the dot in `(()(.()))` has depth 2, because of these parentheses: `(__(.__))`

Our goal is to maintain the score at the current depth we are on. When we see an opening bracket, we increase our depth, and our score at the new depth is 0. When we see a closing bracket, we add twice the score of the previous deeper part - except when counting `()`, which has a score of 1.

For example, when counting `(()(()))`, our stack will look like this:

* `[0, 0]` after parsing `(`
* `[0, 0, 0]` after `(`
* `[0, 1]` after `)`
* `[0, 1, 0]` after `(`
* `[0, 1, 0, 0]` after `(`
* `[0, 1, 1]` after `)`
* `[0, 3]` after `)`
* `[6]` after `)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, S):
        stack = [0] #The score of the current frame

        for x in S:
            if x == '(':
                stack.append(0)
            else:
                v = stack.pop()
                stack[-1] += max(2 * v, 1)

        return stack.pop()
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of `S`.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, the size of the stack.

## Approach 3: Count Cores
**Intuition**

The final sum will be a sum of powers of 2, as every core (a substring `()`, with score 1) will have it's score multiplied by 2 for each exterior set of parentheses that contains that core.

**Algorithm**

Keep track of the balance of the string, as defined in Approach #1. For every `)` that immediately follows a `(`, the answer is `1 << balance`, as `balance` is the number of exterior set of parentheses that contains this core.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, S):
        ans = bal = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(S):
            if x == '(':
                bal += 1
            else:
                bal -= 1
                if S[i-1] == '(':
                    ans += 1 << bal
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of `S`.

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
