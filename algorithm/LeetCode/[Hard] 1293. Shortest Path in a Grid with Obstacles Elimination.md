1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

Given a `m` * `n` grid, where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). In one step, you can move up, down, left or right from and to an empty cell.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m-1, n-1)` given that you can eliminate **at most** `k` obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
grid = 
[[0,0,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,0,0]], 
k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10. 
The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
grid = 
[[0,1,1],
 [1,1,1],
 [1,0,0]], 
k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We need to eliminate at least two obstacles to find such a walk.
```

**Constraints:**

* `grid.length == m`
* `grid[0].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 40`
* `1 <= k <= m*n`
* `grid[i][j] == 0 or 1`
* `grid[0][0] == grid[m-1][n-1] == 0`

**Solution 1:**

On top of BFS, I used an auxiliary dictionary "visited" to keep track of min eliminations used to get to each node, also to avoid repetition.
