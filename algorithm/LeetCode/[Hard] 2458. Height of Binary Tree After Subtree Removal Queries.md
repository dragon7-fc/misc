2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries` of size `m`.

You have to perform m **independent** queries on the tree where in the `i`th query you do the following:

* **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value `queries[i]` from the tree. It is guaranteed that `queries[i]` will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array `answer` of size `m` where `answer[i]` is the height of the tree after performing the `i`th query.

**Note:**

* The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.

* The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.
 

**Example 1:**

![2458_binaryytreeedrawio-1.png](img/2458_binaryytreeedrawio-1.png)
```
Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
```

**Example 2:**

![2458_binaryytreeedrawio-2.png](img/2458_binaryytreeedrawio-2.png)
```
Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= Node.val <= n`
* All the values in the tree are **unique**.
* `m == queries.length`
* `1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4)`
* `1 <= queries[i] <= n`
* `queries[i] != root.val`
