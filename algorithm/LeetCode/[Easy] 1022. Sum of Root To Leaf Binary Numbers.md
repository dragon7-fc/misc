1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers

Given a binary tree, each node has value `0` or `1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers.

 

**Example 1:**

![1022_sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers.png](img/1022_sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers.png)
```
Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
```

**Note:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `1000`.
* `node.val` is `0` or `1`.
* The answer will not exceed `2^31 - 1`.
