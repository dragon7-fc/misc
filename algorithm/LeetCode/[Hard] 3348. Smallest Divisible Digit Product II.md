3348. Smallest Divisible Digit Product II

You are given a string `num` which represents a positive integer, and an integer `t`.

A number is called **zero-free** if none of its digits are 0.

Return a string representing the **smallest zero-free** number greater than or equal to `num` such that the **product of its digits** is divisible by `t`. If no such number exists, return `"-1"`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = "1234", t = 256

Output: "1488"

Explanation:

The smallest zero-free number that is greater than 1234 and has the product of its digits divisible by 256 is 1488, with the product of its digits equal to 256.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = "12355", t = 50

Output: "12355"

Explanation:

12355 is already zero-free and has the product of its digits divisible by 50, with the product of its digits equal to 150.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = "11111", t = 26

Output: "-1"

Explanation:

No number greater than 11111 has the product of its digits divisible by 26.
```
 

**Constraints:**

`2 <= num.length <= 2 * 10^5`
`num` consists only of digits in the range `['0', '9']`.
`num` does not contain leading zeros.
`1 <= t <= 10^14`

**Solution 1: ()**

__Approach__
The digits 1-9 can only contribute the prime factors f = [2, 3, 5, 7]. We calculate the powers of these factors in the factorization of the target number t and store them in the array p, where p[i] represents the power needed for f[i]. If t has any prime factors other than 2, 3, 5, or 7, it means no solution is possible, and we return "-1".

If the minimum number of digits needed is greater than n (the number of digits in num), we directly return the result of build(), since the constructed number will clearly be greater than num.

If num contains any zeros, we replace num with the first zero-free number greater than it by changing all digits from the first occurrence of 0 onward to ones.

The main part involves finding the shortest suffix of num that can be changed to meet the problem's conditions. The array p is continuously updated to reflect the contributions the new suffix needs to provide, in addition to what the unchanged prefix already satisfies. To replace a suffix num[i:], we need to use a digit greater than num[i] and be able to satisfy the requirements in p in n-i-1 digits or less.
