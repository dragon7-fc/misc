3082. Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a positive integer `k`.

The **power** of an array of integers is defined as the number of **subsequences** with their sum **equal** to `k`.

Return the **sum** of **power** of all subsequences of `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 

Output:  6 

Explanation:

There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 3: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 

Output:  4 

Explanation:

There are 3 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [2,3,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 5: [2,3,3] and [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 

Output:  0 

Explanation: There exists no subsequence with sum 7. Hence all subsequences of nums have power = 0.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* `1 <= k <= 100`
