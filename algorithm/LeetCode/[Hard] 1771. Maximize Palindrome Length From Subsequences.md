1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:

* Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from `word1`.
* Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from `word2`.
* Concatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the string.

Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
