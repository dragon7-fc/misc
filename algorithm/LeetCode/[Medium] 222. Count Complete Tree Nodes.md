222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Note:**

**Definition of a complete binary tree** from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        return 0 if not root else 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
