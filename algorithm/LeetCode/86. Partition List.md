86. Partition List

Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example:
```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```
