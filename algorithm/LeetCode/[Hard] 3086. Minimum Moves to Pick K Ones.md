3086. Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones

You are given a **0-indexed** binary array `nums` of length `n`, a positive integer `k` and a non-negative integer `maxChanges`.

Dylan Smith plays a game, where the goal is for Dylan to pick up `k` ones from `nums` using the **minimum** number of **moves**. When the game starts, Dylan picks up any index `dylanIndex` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and stands there. If `nums[dylanIndex] == 1` , Dylan picks up the one and `nums[dylanIndex]` becomes `0`(this **does not** count as a move). After this, Dylan can make **any** number of **moves** (**including zero**) where in each move Dylan must perform **exactly** one of the following actions:

* S0elect any index `j` != `dylanIndex` such that `nums[j] == 0` and set `nums[j] = 1`. This action can be performed at most `maxChanges` times.
* Select any two adjacent indices `x` and `y` (`|x - y| == 1`) such that `nums[x] == 1`, `nums[y] == 0`, then swap their values (set `nums[y] = 1` and `nums[x] = 0`). If `y == dylanIndex`, Dylan picks up the one after this move and `nums[y]` becomes `0`.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required by Dylan to pick **exactly** `k` ones.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k = 3, maxChanges = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: Dylan can pick up 3 ones in 3 moves, if Dylan performs the following actions in each move when standing at dylanIndex == 1:

 At the start of the game Dylan picks up the one and nums[1] becomes 0. nums becomes [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
Select j == 2 and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Select x == 2 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == dylanIndex, Dylan picks up the one and nums becomes [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
Select x == 0 and y == 1, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]. As y == dylanIndex, Dylan picks up the one and nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1].
Note that it may be possible for Dylan to pick up 3 ones using some other sequence of 3 moves.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0], k = 2, maxChanges = 3

Output: 4

Explanation: Dylan can pick up 2 ones in 4 moves, if Dylan performs the following actions in each move when standing at dylanIndex == 0:

Select j == 1 and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0].
Select x == 1 and y == 0, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,0,0,0]. As y == dylanIndex, Dylan picks up the one and nums becomes [0,0,0,0].
Select j == 1 again and perform an action of the first type. nums becomes [0,1,0,0].
Select x == 1 and y == 0 again, and perform an action of the second type. nums becomes [1,0,0,0]. As y == dylanIndex, Dylan picks up the one and nums becomes [0,0,0,0].
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1`
* `1 <= k <= 10^5`
* `0 <= maxChanges <= 10^5`
* `maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k`

**Solution 1: (Minimum Distance of Points)**

__Intuition 1__

The cost of using operation 1 to pick 1, is 2.
The cost of using operation 2 to pick 1, is the distance to that 1.


__Intuition 2__

i - 1, i, i + 1, at most 3 places have diatance <= 2.
We will at most take m + 3 of 1 using operation 2,

and also,
m <= n, where we have n of 1 at the begin.
m <= k, where need k of 1.


__Explanation__

Now the question is simple,
what's the minimum distance from m points in A?

We choose the center of m points as initial index,
and calculate the total distance with prefix skill.

Return the minimum result in the end.


__Complexity__
* Time O(n)
* Space O(n)

            if (nums[i] > 0)
                A.push_back(A.back() + i);
        int n = A.size() - 1, m = max(0, k - maxChanges);

        for (int l = m; l <= min(n, min(m + 3, k)); ++l) {

                int mid1 = i + l / 2, mid2 = i + l - l / 2;
                long long cur = A[i + l] - A[mid2] - (A[mid1] - A[i]);
                res = min(res, cur + (k - l) * 2);
            }
        }
