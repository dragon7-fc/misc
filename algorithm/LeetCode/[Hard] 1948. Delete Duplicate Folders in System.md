1948. Delete Duplicate Folders in System

Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.

* For example, `["one", "two", "three"]` represents the path `"/one/two/three"`.

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are **identical** if they contain the **same non-empty** set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders **do not** need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are **identical**, then **mark** the folders as well as all their subfolders.

* For example, folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
    * `/a`
    * `/a/x`
    * `/a/x/y`
    * `/a/z`
    * `/b`
    * `/b/x`
    * `/b/x/y`
    * `/b/z`

* However, if the file structure also included the path `"/b/w"`, then the folders `"/a"` and `"/b"` would not be identical. Note that `"/a/x"` and `"/b/x"` would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will **delete** all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return the 2D array `ans` containing the paths of the **remaining** folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in **any** order.

 

**Example 1:**

![1948_lc-dupfolder1.jpg ](img/1948_lc-dupfolder1.jpg)
```
Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named "b".
```

**Example 2:**

![1948_lc-dupfolder2.jpg](img/1948_lc-dupfolder2.jpg)
```
Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.
```

**Example 3:**

![1948_lc-dupfolder3.jpg](img/1948_lc-dupfolder3.jpg)
```
Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.
```

**Example 4:**

![1948_lc-dupfolder4_.jpg](img/1948_lc-dupfolder4_.jpg)
```
Input: paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"]]
Output: []
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an
empty folder named "y".
Folders "/a" and "/b" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder "z" and the folder "x" described above.
```

**Example 5:**

![1948_lc-dupfolder5_.jpg](img/1948_lc-dupfolder5_.jpg)
```
Input: paths = [["a"],["a","x"],["a","x","y"],["a","z"],["b"],["b","x"],["b","x","y"],["b","z"],["b","w"]]
Output: [["b"],["b","w"],["b","z"],["a"],["a","z"]]
Explanation: This has the same structure as the previous example, except with the added "/b/w".
Folders "/a/x" and "/b/x" are still marked, but "/a" and "/b" are no longer marked because "/b" has the
empty folder named "w" and "/a" does not.
Note that "/a/z" and "/b/z" are not marked because the set of identical subfolders must be non-empty, but these folders are empty.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4`
* `1 <= paths[i].length <= 500`
* `1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10`
* `1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 10^5`
* `path[i][j]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* No two paths lead to the same folder.
* For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.
