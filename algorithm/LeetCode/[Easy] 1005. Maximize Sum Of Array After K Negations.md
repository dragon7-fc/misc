1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations

Given an array `A` of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an `i` and replace `A[i]` with `-A[i]`, and we repeat this process `K` times in total.  (We may choose the same index `i` multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [4,2,3], K = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose indices (1,) and A becomes [4,-2,3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: A = [3,-1,0,2], K = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: A = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], K = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
* `1 <= K <= 10000`
* `-100 <= A[i] <= 100`
