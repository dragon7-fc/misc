2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number

The **k-beauty** of an integer `num` is defined as the number of **substrings** of `num` when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

* It has a length of `k`.
* It is a divisor of `num`.

Given integers `num` and `k`, return the k-beauty of `num`.

**Note:**

* **Leading zeros** are allowed.
* `0` is not a divisor of any value.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 240, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 430043, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= num.length` (taking `num` as a string)
