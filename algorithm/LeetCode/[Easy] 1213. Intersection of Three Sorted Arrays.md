1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays

Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` **sorted** in **strictly increasing** order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in **all** three arrays.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.
``` 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000`
