1029. Two City Scheduling

There are `2N` people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the `i`-th person to city A is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city B is `costs[i][1]`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `N` people arrive in each city.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= costs.length <= 100`
* It is guaranteed that `costs.length` is even.
* `1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000`
