1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence

You are given an array `target` that consists of **distinct** integers and another integer array `arr` that can have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. For example, if `arr = [1,4,1,2]`, you can add `3` in the middle and make it `[1,4,3,1,2]`. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a **subsequence** of `arr`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,2,3,7,2,1,4]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 10^9`
* `target contains no duplicates`.
