3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Select an index `i` and replace `nums[i]` with `nums[i] - 1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by `k`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,9,7], k = 5

Output: 4

Explanation:

Perform 4 operations on nums[1] = 9. Now, nums = [3, 5, 7].
The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,3], k = 4

Output: 0

Explanation:

The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2], k = 6

Output: 5

Explanation:

Perform 3 operations on nums[0] = 3 and 2 operations on nums[1] = 2. Now, nums = [0, 0].
The sum is 0, which is divisible by 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= 100`
