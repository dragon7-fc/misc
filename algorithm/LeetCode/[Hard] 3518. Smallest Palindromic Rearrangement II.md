3518. Smallest Palindromic Rearrangement II

You are given a palindromic string `s` and an integer `k`.

Return the `k`-th **lexicographically smallest** palindromic permutation of `s`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct palindromic permutations, return an empty string.

**Note**: Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are considered identical and are counted once.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abba", k = 2

Output: "baab"

Explanation:

The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of "abba" are "abba" and "baab".
Lexicographically, "abba" comes before "baab". Since k = 2, the output is "baab".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aa", k = 2

Output: ""

Explanation:

There is only one palindromic rearrangement: "aa".
The output is an empty string since k = 2 exceeds the number of possible rearrangements.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "bacab", k = 1

Output: "abcba"

Explanation:

The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of "bacab" are "abcba" and "bacab".
Lexicographically, "abcba" comes before "bacab". Since k = 1, the output is "abcba".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `s` is guaranteed to be palindromic.
* `1 <= k <= 106`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

__Intuition__
The key insight is that to form a palindrome, most characters must appear an even number of times, with at most one character appearing an odd number of times (which would be placed in the middle). Since we need to find the kth smallest palindrome lexicographically, we need to construct the palindrome character by character, starting from the beginning.

We only need to determine the first half of the palindrome (plus the middle character if there is one), since the second half is just the reverse of the first half.

__Approach__
Count the frequency of each character in the input string.
Identify if there's a middle character (a character with an odd frequency).
Create a list of character counts for the first half of the palindrome.
Calculate the total number of possible palindromes to check if k is valid.
Build the first half of the palindrome character by character:
For each position, try each character (in alphabetical order).
For each character, calculate how many palindromes would start with this prefix.
If k is greater than this count, skip this character and reduce k by the count.
Otherwise, use this character and move to the next position.
Construct the full palindrome by combining the first half, middle character (if any), and the reversed first half.
Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through Example 1: s = "abba", k = 2

Character frequencies: a: 2, b: 2
No middle character (all frequencies are even)
Half palindrome character counts: a: 1, b: 1
The length of half palindrome is 2
Total possible palindromes: C(2,1) = 2 (we can choose 1 position for 'a' out of 2 positions)
Building the first half:
First position:
Try 'a': There's 1 palindrome with 'a' in the first position. Since k=2, we skip 'a'.
Try 'b': We use 'b' (k=1 now)
Second position:
Only 'a' is left, so we use 'a'.
First half: "ba"
Full palindrome: "ba" + "" + "ab" = "baab"
For Another Example: s = "ngyygn", k = 4

Character frequencies: g: 2, n: 2, y: 2
No middle character
Half palindrome character counts: g: 1, n: 1, y: 1
The length of half palindrome is 3
Total possible palindromes: 3! = 6 (we can arrange the 3 distinct characters in 3 positions)
Building the first half:
First position:
Try 'g': There are 2 palindromes with 'g' in the first position. Since k=4, we skip 'g' and set k=2.
Try 'n': There are 2 palindromes with 'n' in the first position. Since k=2, we use 'n' and set k=0.
Second position:
Try 'g': There's 1 palindrome with 'g' in the second position. Since k=0, we use 'g'.
Third position:
Only 'y' is left, so we use 'y'.
First half: "ngy"
Full palindrome: "ngy" + "" + "ygn" = "ngyygn"
__Complexity Analysis__
Time Complexity: O(n + k), where n is the length of the input string and k is the kth smallest palindrome. The dominant factor is building the palindrome character by character, which takes O(k) time in the worst case.

Space Complexity: O(1) since we use a fixed-size array (26 characters) to count character frequencies.
