3495. Minimum Operations to Make Array Elements Zero

You are given a 2D array `queries`, where `queries[i]` is of the form `[l, r`]. Each queries[i] defines an array of integers `nums` consisting of elements ranging from `l` to `r`, both inclusive.

In one operation, you can:

* Select two integers `a` and `b` from the array.
* Replace them with `floor(a / 4)` and `floor(b / 4)`.

Your task is to determine the **minimum** number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array to zero for each query. Return the sum of the results for all queries.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: queries = [[1,2],[2,4]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

For queries[0]:

The initial array is nums = [1, 2].
In the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[1]. The array becomes [0, 0].
The minimum number of operations required is 1.
For queries[1]:

The initial array is nums = [2, 3, 4].
In the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 3, 1].
In the second operation, select nums[1] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0].
The minimum number of operations required is 2.
The output is 1 + 2 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: queries = [[2,6]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

For queries[0]:

The initial array is nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
In the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[3]. The array becomes [0, 3, 4, 1, 6].
In the second operation, select nums[2] and nums[4]. The array becomes [0, 3, 1, 1, 1].
In the third operation, select nums[1] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].
In the fourth operation, select nums[3] and nums[4]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
The minimum number of operations required is 4.
The output is 4.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `queries[i] == [l, r]`
* `1 <= l < r <= 10^9`
