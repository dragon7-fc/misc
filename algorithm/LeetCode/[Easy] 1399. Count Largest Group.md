1399. Count Largest Group

Given an integer `n`. Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits. 

Return how many groups have the largest size.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 15
Output: 6
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 24
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
