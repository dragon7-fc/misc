1360. Number of Days Between Two Dates

Write a program to count the number of days between two dates.

The two dates are given as strings, their format is `YYYY-MM-DD` as shown in the examples.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: date1 = "2019-06-29", date2 = "2019-06-30"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: date1 = "2020-01-15", date2 = "2019-12-31"
Output: 15
```

**Constraints:**

* The given dates are valid dates between the years `1971` and `2100`.
