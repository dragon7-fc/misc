3828. Final Element After Subarray Deletions

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Two players, Alice and Bob, play a game in turns, with Alice playing first.

* In each turn, the current player chooses any subarray `nums[l..r]` such that `r - l + 1 < m`, where `m` is the current length of the array.
* The selected subarray is removed, and the remaining elements are concatenated to form the new array.
* The game continues until only one element remains.

Alice aims to **maximize** the final element, while Bob aims to **minimize** it. Assuming both play optimally, return the value of the final remaining element.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]

Output: 2

Explanation:

One valid optimal strategy:

Alice removes [1], array becomes [5, 2].
Bob removes [5], array becomes [2]. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,7]

Output: 7

Explanation:

Alice removes [3], leaving the array [7]. Since Bob cannot play a turn now, the answer is 7.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

**Solution 1: (Brainteaser)**

Alice can pick the larger of the two ends, let's say a.
Bob can pick the smaller of the two ends.

Alice ensures that after her move,
both ends are greater than or equal to a.

Bob ensures that after his move,
both ends are less than or equal to a.

Therefore, the final result will definitely be a.
