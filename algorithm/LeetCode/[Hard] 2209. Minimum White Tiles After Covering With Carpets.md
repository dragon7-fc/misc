2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `floor`, which represents the colors of tiles on a floor:

* `floor[i] = '0'` denotes that the `i`th tile of the floor is colored **black**.
* On the other hand, `floor[i] = '1'` denotes that the ith tile of the floor is colored **white**.

You are also given `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` **black** carpets, each of length `carpetLen` tiles. Cover the tiles with the given carpets such that the number of **white** tiles still visible is **minimum**. Carpets may overlap one another.

Return the **minimum** number of white tiles still visible.

 

**Example 1:**

![2209_ex1-1.png](img/2209_ex1-1.png)
```
Input: floor = "10110101", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that only 2 white tiles are visible.
No other way of covering the tiles with the carpets can leave less than 2 white tiles visible.
```

**Example 2:**

![2209_ex2.png](img/2209_ex2.png)
```
Input: floor = "11111", numCarpets = 2, carpetLen = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
The figure above shows one way of covering the tiles with the carpets such that no white tiles are visible.
Note that the carpets are able to overlap one another.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= carpetLen <= floor.length <= 1000`
* `floor[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `1 <= numCarpets <= 1000`
