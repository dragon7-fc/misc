2347. Best Poker Hand

You are given an integer array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. You have 5 cards where the `i`th card has a rank of `ranks[i]` and a suit of `suits[i]`.

The following are the types of **poker hands** you can make from best to worst:

1. "Flush": Five cards of the same suit.
1. "Three of a Kind": Three cards of the same rank.
1. "Pair": Two cards of the same rank.
1. "High Card": Any single card.

Return a string representing the **best** type of **poker hand** you can    make with the given cards.

**Note** that the return values are **case-sensitive**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ranks = [13,2,3,1,9], suits = ["a","a","a","a","a"]
Output: "Flush"
Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a "Flush".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ranks = [4,4,2,4,4], suits = ["d","a","a","b","c"]
Output: "Three of a Kind"
Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a "Three of a Kind".
Note that we could also make a "Pair" hand but "Three of a Kind" is a better hand.
Also note that other cards could be used to make the "Three of a Kind" hand.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: ranks = [10,10,2,12,9], suits = ["a","b","c","a","d"]
Output: "Pair"
Explanation: The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards with the same rank, so we have a "Pair".
Note that we cannot make a "Flush" or a "Three of a Kind".
```

**Constraints:**

* `ranks.length == suits.length == 5`
* `1 <= ranks[i] <= 13`
* `'a' <= suits[i] <= 'd'`
* No two cards have the same `rank` and `suit`.
