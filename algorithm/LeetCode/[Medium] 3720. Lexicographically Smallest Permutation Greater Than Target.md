3720. Lexicographically Smallest Permutation Greater Than Target

You are given two strings `s` and `target`, both having length `n`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the **lexicographically smallest permutation** of `s` that is **strictly** greater than `target`. If no permutation of s is lexicographically strictly greater than `target`, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically strictly greater than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc", target = "bba"

Output: "bca"

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "bca".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "leet", target = "code"

Output: "eelt"

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "eelt", "eetl", "elet", "elte", "etel", "etle", "leet", "lete", "ltee", "teel", "tele", and "tlee".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "eelt".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"

Output: ""

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "aabb", "abab", "abba", "baab", "baba", and "bbaa".
None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length == target.length <= 300`
* `s` and `target` consist of only lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (Backtracking, Pruning)**

Intuition
We are asked to find the lexicographically smallest permutation of s that is strictly greater than a given string target.

My first thought was to try generating all permutations of s and comparing them to target, but this is infeasible for large strings (n â‰¤ 300) because the number of permutations is n!.

Instead, I realized we could use backtracking with pruning:

Build the permutation character by character.

Keep track of the characters left to use using a frequency array.

Stop exploring branches that cannot possibly be strictly greater than target.

This ensures we find the lexicographically smallest valid permutation efficiently.

Approach
Count the frequency of each character in s using a cnt[26] array.
Use a backtracking function to build the permutation step by step:

path stores the current prefix.

big is a boolean indicating whether the current prefix is already strictly greater than target.

At each step i in the permutation:

Iterate over characters 'a' to 'z'.

Skip any character that is not available (cnt[c] == 0).

If big == false (prefix equals target so far), skip characters < target[i].

Choose a character, decrement its count, and recursively call the function with updated big.

Once a full permutation is formed:
If big == true (prefix is strictly greater than target), record it as ans and stop recursion.

Return ans. If no valid permutation exists, ans remains empty.

This way we prune unnecessary branches, avoid generating all permutations and getting the lexicographically smallest valid string.

Complexity
Time complexity:
In the worst case, we may explore all permutations, but pruning significantly reduces the search space.

Practically, it is much faster than O(n!) because we skip branches that cannot exceed target.

The exact worst-case is difficult to express, but the effective complexity is much less than O(n!).

Space complexity: O(n)
