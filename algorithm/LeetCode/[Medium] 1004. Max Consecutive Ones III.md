1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, we may change up to `K` values from `0` to `1`.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only `1`s. 

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
* `0 <= K <= A.length`
* `A[i]` is `0` or `1`
