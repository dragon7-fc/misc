3414. Maximum Score of Non-overlapping Intervals

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]`. Interval `i` starts at position `li` and ends at `ri`, and has a weight of `weighti`. You can choose up to **4 non-overlapping** intervals. The score of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their weights.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** array of at most 4 indices from `intervals` with **maximum** score, representing your choice of non-overlapping intervals.

Two intervals are said to be **non-overlapping** if they do not share any points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are considered overlapping.

An array `a` is **lexicographically** smaller than an array `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, array `a` has an element that is less than the corresponding element in `b`.
If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` elements do not differ, then the shorter array is the lexicographically smaller one.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]

Output: [2,3]

Explanation:

You can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of 5, and 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]

Output: [1,3,5,6]

Explanation:

You can choose the intervals with indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 with respective weights of 7, 6, 3, and 5.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `intervals[i].length == 3`
* `intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]`
* `1 <= li <= ri <= 10^9`
* `1 <= weighti <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (DP)**

__Explanation__
dp(i, k) means to find k intervals from A[i] to A[n - 1].

In dp(i, k), we have two options:
we can skip A[i], continue to search in dp(i + 1, k)
we can pick A[i], add the weith A[i][2], then search dp(i + 1, k - 1)
We will compare the result from skip and pick.
This recursion will exit when i == n or k == 0.

Just call and return the result of dp(0, 4)
