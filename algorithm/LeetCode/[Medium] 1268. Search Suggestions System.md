1268. Search Suggestions System

Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested `products` should have common prefix with the `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed. 

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4`
* All characters of `products[i]` are lower-case English letters.
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
* All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
