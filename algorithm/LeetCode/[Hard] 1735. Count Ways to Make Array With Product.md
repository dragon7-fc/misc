1735. Count Ways to Make Array With Product

You are given a 2D integer array, `queries`. For each `queries[i]`, where `queries[i] = [ni, ki]`, find the number of different ways you can place positive integers into an array of size `ni` such that the product of the integers is `ki`. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the `i`th query is the number of ways modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer.length == queries.length`, and `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th `query`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: queries = [[2,6],[5,1],[73,660]]
Output: [4,1,50734910]
Explanation: Each query is independent.
[2,6]: There are 4 ways to fill an array of size 2 that multiply to 6: [1,6], [2,3], [3,2], [6,1].
[5,1]: There is 1 way to fill an array of size 5 that multiply to 1: [1,1,1,1,1].
[73,660]: There are 1050734917 ways to fill an array of size 73 that multiply to 660. 1050734917 modulo 109 + 7 = 50734910.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: queries = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: [1,2,3,10,5]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= ni, ki <= 10^4`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

First we find all the possible ways (and orders) that the query can be factored, and then for each way we can factor it, we use math to see how many ways we can place these numbers into an array of the queried size.

Note: We don't actually have to store the contents of the factor tree, just the length of the factorization for each way.

So for a query of [4, 4] we get [2,2], and [4], so one of length 1 and one of length 2, and then we see how many ways we can place this into an array of size 4 using the comb() function in python. We can place choose one number in an array of size 4 four ways, and choose two numbers in an array of size 4 six ways, giving us a total of 4 + 6 = 10 ways.
