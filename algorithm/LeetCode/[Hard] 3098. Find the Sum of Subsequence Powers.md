3098. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and a **positive** integer `k`.

The **power** of a subsequence  is defined as the **minimum** absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.

Return the **sum** of **powers** of **all** subsequences of nums which have length **equal** to `k`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3

Output: 4

Explanation:

There are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4]. The sum of powers is |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2], k = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:

The only subsequence in nums which has length 2 is [2,2]. The sum of powers is |2 - 2| = 0.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2

Output: 10

Explanation:

There are 3 subsequences in nums which have length 2: [4,3], [4,-1], and [3,-1]. The sum of powers is |4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n == nums.length <= 50`
* `-10^8 <= nums[i] <= 10^8`
* `2 <= k <= n`
