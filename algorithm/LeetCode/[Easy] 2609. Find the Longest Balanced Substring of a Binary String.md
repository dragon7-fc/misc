2609. Find the Longest Balanced Substring of a Binary String

You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of zeroes and ones.

A substring of s is considered balanced if **all zeroes are before ones** and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

Return the length of the longest balanced substring of `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "01000111"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "000111", which has length 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "00111"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest balanced substring is "0011", which has length 4. 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "111"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 50`
* `'0' <= s[i] <= '1'`

            if (s[i] == '0')
                c0 = c1 ? 1 : c0 + 1;
            c1 = s[i] == '0' ? 0 : c1 + 1;
            res = max(res, 2 * min(c0, c1));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
