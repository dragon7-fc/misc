1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string `s` consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` only consists of letters `'a'` and `'b'`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

**Basic**

You need to know the difference between subarray and subsequence.
* Subarray need to be consecutiveã€‚
* Subsequence don't have to be consecutive.


**Intuition**

* If it's empty sting, return `0`;
* If it's palindrome, return `1`;
* Otherwise, we need at least `2` operation.


**Explanation**

* We can delete all characters `'a'` in the 1st operation, and then all characters `'b'` in the 2nd operation.
* So return `2` in this case


**Complexity**

* Time O(N)
* Space O(N), also O(1) space checking palindrome is suuggested.

            if(s[i]!=s[j]) return 2;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        
        return 1;
