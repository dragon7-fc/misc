2663. Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String

A string is **beautiful** if:

* It consists of the first `k` letters of the English lowercase alphabet.
* It does not contain any substring of length `2` or more which is a palindrome.

You are given a beautiful string `s` of length `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Return the lexicographically smallest string of length `n`, which is larger than `s` and is beautiful. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`.

For example, `"abcd"` is lexicographically larger than `"abcc"` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcz", k = 26
Output: "abda"
Explanation: The string "abda" is beautiful and lexicographically larger than the string "abcz".
It can be proven that there is no string that is lexicographically larger than the string "abcz", beautiful, and lexicographically smaller than the string "abda".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "dc", k = 4
Output: ""
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no string that is lexicographically larger than the string "dc" and is beautiful.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == s.length <= 10^5`
* `4 <= k <= 26`
* `s` is a beautiful string.

**Solution 1: (Weird Problem)**

I did not realize that the input string s is always beautiful, and solved a more complex problem.

This problem is not hard - as soon as you realize how you can change characters.

If a string does not contain a palindrome, you can change s[i] to any character, providing:

s[i] != s[i - 1], and
s[i] != s[i - 2].
It can be shown that such change would not produce any palindrome substring within [0, i] range.

Note that here we can only increment s[i] (or the resultng stringi will be smaller).

So, we go right-to-left, and try to increment s[i] to a valid character.

If the resulting character is less than 'a' + k, we fill the string on the right with the smallest non-palindromic substring.

If not, we try the next character to the left.

        auto valid = [&](int i) {
            return (i < 1 || s[i] != s[i - 1]) && (i < 2 || s[i] != s[i - 2]);
        };
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            ++s[i];
            while (!valid(i))
                ++s[i];
            if (s[i] < 'a' + k) {
                for (i = i + 1; i < s.size(); ++i)
                    for (s[i] = 'a'; !valid(i); ++s[i]) ;
                return s;            
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
};
```

**Solution 2: (Different Three Continuous Character)**

__Intuition__
If there is a palindrome with even length,
there must be a palindrome with length = 2.

If there is a palindrome with odd length,
there must be a palindrome with length = 3.

Reversely,
If s[i] == s[i + 1], s[i], s[i + 1] is a palindrome.
If s[i] == s[i + 2], s[i], s[i + 1], s[i + 2] is a palindrome.

So,
If s[i] != s[i + 1] and s[i] != s[i + 2] for all indices i,
s is beautiful.

In anothor words,
If any three continuous characters is different,
s is beautiful.


Explanation
Optionally, transform s to integer array A.

Then iterate array A reversely,
increment each digit,
and check if it's same with its previous two digits.
If any duplicate, we continue increment the digits, until it's k.
Since it's like base-k number, we iterate the digit.

Continue doing this until no duplicate,
then we try to complete remaining digits by 0,1,2 alternatively.


__Complexity__
* Time O(n)
* Space O(n)
