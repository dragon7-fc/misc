3345. Smallest Divisible Digit Product I

You are given two integers `n` and `t`. Return the **smallest** number greater than or equal to `n` such that the **product of its digits** is divisible by `t`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 10, t = 2

Output: 10

Explanation:

The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 15, t = 3

Output: 16

Explanation:

The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= t <= 10`
