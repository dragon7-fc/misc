2132. Stamping the Grid

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied).

You are then given stamps of size `stampHeight x stampWidth`. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given restrictions and requirements:

* Cover all the empty cells.
* Do not cover any of the occupied cells.
* We can put as many stamps as we want.
* Stamps can overlap with each other.
* Stamps are not allowed to be rotated.
* Stamps must stay completely inside the grid.

Return `true` if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

![2132_ex1.png](img/2132_ex1.png)
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
Output: true
Explanation: We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.
```

**Example 2:**

![2132_ex2.png](img/2132_ex2.png)
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2, stampWidth = 2 
Output: false 
Explanation: There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells without the stamps going outside the grid.
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[r].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= m * n <= 2 * 10^5`
* `grid[r][c]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 10^5`

**Solution 1: (Calulate the sub-matrix sum twice)**

__Intitution__
M[i][j] can be coverd by any stamp with right-bottom point
in the sub-matrix from (i,j) to (i + h - 1, j + w - 1).

A stamp with right-bottom point at (i,j) can fit,
if the sub the sub-matrix from (i - h + 1, j - w + 1) to (i,j) is all empty.

So we just need to calulate the sub-matrix sum twice.


__Explanation__
M is the input matrix.

A[i][j] means the total empty points in the rectangle,
with top-left at (0, 0) and right-bottom at (i - 1, j - 1).

good[i][j] means it fits a stamp with stamp right-bottom at (i, j)

B[i][j] means the sub-martix is all empty,
with top-left at (0, 0) and right-bottom at (i - 1, j - 1)

M[i][j] can be coverd by any stamp with right-bottom point
in the sub-matrix from (i,j) to (i + w - 1, j + h - 1).


__Complexity__
* Time O(mn)
* Space O(mn)
