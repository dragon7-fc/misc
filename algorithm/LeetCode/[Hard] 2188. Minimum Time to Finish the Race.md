2188. Minimum Time to Finish the Race

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array tires where `tires[i] = [fi, ri]` indicates that the `i`th tire can finish its xth successive lap in `fi * ri^(x-1)` seconds.

* For example, if `fi = 3` and `ri = 2`, then the tire would finish its `1st` lap in `3` seconds, its `2nd` lap in `3 * 2 = 6` seconds, its `3rd` lap in `3 * 2^2 = 12` seconds, etc.

You are also given an integer `changeTime` and an integer `numLaps`.

The race consists of `numLaps` laps and you may start the race with **any** tire. You have an **unlimited** supply of each tire and after every lap, you may **change** to any given tire (including the current tire type) if you wait `changeTime` seconds.

Return the **minimum** time to finish the race.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: tires = [[2,3],[3,4]], changeTime = 5, numLaps = 4
Output: 21
Explanation: 
Lap 1: Start with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 0 for 5 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 0 and finish the lap in 2 * 3 = 6 seconds.
Total time = 2 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 21 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 21 seconds.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: tires = [[1,10],[2,2],[3,4]], changeTime = 6, numLaps = 5
Output: 25
Explanation: 
Lap 1: Start with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 seconds.
Lap 2: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 3: Change tires to a new tire 1 for 6 seconds and then finish the lap in another 2 seconds.
Lap 4: Continue with tire 1 and finish the lap in 2 * 2 = 4 seconds.
Lap 5: Change tires to tire 0 for 6 seconds then finish the lap in another 1 second.
Total time = 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 25 seconds.
The minimum time to complete the race is 25 seconds. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= tires.length <= 10^5`
* `tires[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= fi, changeTime <= 10^5`
* `2 <= ri <= 10^5`
* `1 <= numLaps <= 1000`

        return optimal[-1]
```

**Solution 2: (DP Bottom-Up)**

This problem seems very hard at first glance, but would be way easier with just one observation.

Observation
Given changeTime <= 10^5, it won't be optimal if we use any tire consecutively without change for larger than 18 laps.
Let's consider the extreme case, when f_i == 1 and r_i == 2
| consecutive laps | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| time on the last lap | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16| 32| 64|128|256| 512

| consecutive laps | 11 | 12 | 13|14|15|16|17|18|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| time on the last lap |1024|2048|4096|8192|16384|32768|65536|131072|

it is obvious that at the 18-th consecutive lap, it is alway better to change a tire (even when f_i and r_i are given their smallest possible values).
this observation leads to two lemmas
Lemma 1.
If numLaps >= 18, we must change tire in some point of time in any optimal way.
Lemma 2.
After changing a tire, an optimal way won't have the tire running for more than 18 consecutive laps.
Algorithm
from the above discussion, we can form a dp like:
dp[x] := the minimum time to finish x laps
base case: dp[1] = min(f_i) among all tires
transition: dp[x] = min(dp[j] + changeTime + dp[x-j]) among all possible js
meaning: the minimum time to finish x laps is the minimum time to finish j laps first and change a tire at the end of j-th lap, plus the minimum time to finish the last x-j laps.
which js are possible ?
from Lemma 2. we know j >= x-18 must hold.
It leads to a constant time transition.
note that if x < 18, it's possible that an optimal solution never changes a tire.
