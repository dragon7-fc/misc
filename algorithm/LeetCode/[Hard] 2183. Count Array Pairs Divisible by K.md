2183. Count Array Pairs Divisible by K

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return the **number of pairs** `(i, j)` such that:

* `0 <= i < j <= n - 1` and
* `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: 
The 7 pairs of indices whose corresponding products are divisible by 2 are
(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
Their products are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 respectively.
Other pairs such as (0, 2) and (2, 4) have products 3 and 15 respectively, which are not divisible by 2.    
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist any pair of indices whose corresponding product is divisible by 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^5`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

* Firstly, generate all divisors of k.
* Secondly, for each index i in nums, count the number of index j hold:
    * j < i
    * nums[j] MOD k/GCD(k, nums[i]) == 0
* Obviously, k/GCD(k, nums[i]) is a divisor of k. Therefore, we just need a counter to maintain the number of elements on the left divisible for each divisor of k.

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(N * sqrt(K))
* Space: O(sqrt(K))

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        N, output = len(nums), 0
        divisors = []
        counter = Counter()
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            if k % i == 0:
                divisors.append(i)
        
        for i in range(0, N):
            remainder = k // math.gcd(k, nums[i])
            output += counter[remainder]
            for divisor in divisors:
                if nums[i] % divisor == 0:
                    counter[divisor] += 1
            
        return output
```

**Solution 2: (Math)**

This problem is similar to an easy problem from today's biweekly (2176. Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array).

A brute-force solution is accepted for the easy problem (inputs are limited to 1000). This one is hard, so we must do better than O(n * n).

Intuition
A number with a factor i will form a pair with a number with a factor j if i * j is divisible by k.

It can be shown that if n1 * n2 % k == 0, then gcd(n1, k) * gcd(n2, k) % k == 0.

Approach 1: Count GCDs
Track count of each GCD we encountered so far in a map. For each number, check its GCD agains all previous GCDs.

    long long countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long res = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> gcds;
        for (int n : nums) {
            long long gcd_i = gcd(n, k);
            for (auto [gcd_j, cnt] : gcds)
                res += gcd_i * gcd_j % k ? 0 : cnt;
            ++gcds[gcd_i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
