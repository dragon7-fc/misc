2813. Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `items` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

`items[i] = [profiti, categoryi]`, where `profiti` and `categoryi` denote the profit and category of the `i`th item respectively.

Let's define the **elegance** of a **subsequence** of items as `total_profit + distinct_categories^2`, where `total_profit` is the sum of all profits in the subsequence, and `distinct_categories` is the number of **distinct** categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.

Your task is to find the **maximum elegance** from all subsequences of size `k` in `items`.

Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of `items` with size exactly `k`.

**Note:** A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: items = [[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], k = 2
Output: 17
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 2.
We can select items[0] = [3,2] and items[2] = [10,1].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 10 = 13, and the subsequence contains 2 distinct categories [2,1].
Hence, the elegance is 13 + 22 = 17, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: items = [[3,1],[3,1],[2,2],[5,3]], k = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We can select items[0] = [3,1], items[2] = [2,2], and items[3] = [5,3]. 
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10, and the subsequence contains 3 distinct categories [1,2,3]. 
Hence, the elegance is 10 + 32 = 19, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: items = [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3. 
We should select all the items. 
The total profit will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the subsequence contains 1 distinct category [1]. 
Hence, the maximum elegance is 6 + 12 = 7.  
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= items.length == n <= 10^5`
* `items[i].length == 2`
* `items[i][0] == profiti`
* `items[i][1] == categoryi`
* `1 <= profiti <= 10^9`
* `1 <= categoryi <= n `
* `1 <= k <= n`

**Solution 1: (Sort by Profit)**

__Intuition__
Sort items by decresed profiti,
and we take k first items.
This is biggest total_profit we can have.


__Explanation__
Continue to iterate the remaining n - k items.
We can try to take them,
if this is a new category and not in seen set.

But we already have k items,
so we replace one item with smallest profit
which has a duplicate category.

We continue doing this,
until every category has no two items.

Finally return the max result.


__Complexity__
* Time O(nlogn)
* Space O(n)

                    dup.push_back(items[i][0]);
                }

            } else if (seen.find(items[i][1]) == seen.end()) {
