3620. Network Recovery Pathways

You are given a directed acyclic graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n − 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `m`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, costi]` indicates a one‑way communication from node `ui` to node `vi` with a recovery cost of `costi`.

Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array `online` where `online[i] = true` means node i is online. Nodes 0 and `n − 1` are always online.

A path from 0 to `n − 1` is valid if:

* All intermediate nodes on the path are online.
* The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed `k`.
* For each valid path, define its score as the **minimum** edge‑cost along that path.

Return the **maximum** path score (i.e., the largest **minimum**-edge cost) among all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: edges = [[0,1,5],[1,3,10],[0,2,3],[2,3,4]], online = [true,true,true,true], k = 10

Output: 3

Explanation:
```
![3620_graph-10.png](img/3620_graph-10.png)
```
The graph has two possible routes from node 0 to node 3:

Path 0 → 1 → 3

Total cost = 5 + 10 = 15, which exceeds k (15 > 10), so this path is invalid.

Path 0 → 2 → 3

Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7 <= k, so this path is valid.

The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(3, 4) = 3.

There are no other valid paths. Hence, the maximum among all valid path‐scores is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: edges = [[0,1,7],[1,4,5],[0,2,6],[2,3,6],[3,4,2],[2,4,6]], online = [true,true,true,false,true], k = 12

Output: 6

Explanation:
```

```
Node 3 is offline, so any path passing through 3 is invalid.

Consider the remaining routes from 0 to 4:

Path 0 → 1 → 4

Total cost = 7 + 5 = 12 <= k, so this path is valid.

The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(7, 5) = 5.

Path 0 → 2 → 3 → 4

Node 3 is offline, so this path is invalid regardless of cost.

Path 0 → 2 → 4

Total cost = 6 + 6 = 12 <= k, so this path is valid.

The minimum edge‐cost along this path is min(6, 6) = 6.

Among the two valid paths, their scores are 5 and 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `n == online.length`
* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= m == edges.length <= min(10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `edges[i] = [ui, vi, costi]`
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `ui != vi`
* `0 <= costi <= 10^9`
* `0 <= k <= 5 * 10^13`
* `online[i]` is either `true` or `false`, and both `online[0]` and `online[n − 1]` are `true`.
* The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
