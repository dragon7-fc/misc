3229. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target

You are given two positive integer arrays `nums` and `target`, of the same length.

In a single operation, you can select any **subarray** of `nums` and increment or decrement each element within that subarray by `1`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make `nums` equal to the array `target`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,5,1,2], target = [4,6,2,4]

Output: 2

Explanation:

We will perform the following operations to make nums equal to target:
- Increment nums[0..3] by 1, nums = [4,6,2,3].
- Increment nums[3..3] by 1, nums = [4,6,2,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2], target = [2,1,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

We will perform the following operations to make nums equal to target:
- Increment nums[0..0] by 1, nums = [2,3,2].
- Decrement nums[1..1] by 1, nums = [2,2,2].
- Decrement nums[1..1] by 1, nums = [2,1,2].
- Increment nums[2..2] by 1, nums = [2,1,3].
- Increment nums[2..2] by 1, nums = [2,1,4].
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length == target.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 10^8`

**Solution 1: (Greedy)**

__Intuition__
Start from left or right, and just loop through array and keep track of possible increments & decrements we can do till current point

__Approach__
We start from left, and do required incr/decr needed for first number.
From here on, for each number, if it needs more increment than what we already have, then increase the steps, and also update count of how many extra increments we have done.
Similarly keep track of decrements.
If we are changing incr then decr has to become 0, and vice versa
If we encounter an index which has same value in nums and target, then both incr then decr become 0 because there is no change
At the end you will have answer

__Complexity__
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

        int n = nums.size();
        long incr = 0, decr = 0, ops = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long diff = target[i] - nums[i];

            if (diff > 0) {
                if (incr < diff)
                    ops += diff - incr;
                incr = diff;
                decr = 0;
            } else if (diff < 0) {
                if (diff < decr)
                    ops += decr - diff;
                decr = diff;
                incr = 0;
            } else {
                incr = decr = 0;
            }
        }

        return ops;
    }
};
