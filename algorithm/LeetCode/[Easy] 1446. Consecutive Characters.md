1446. Consecutive Characters

Given a string `s`, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
