1025. Divisor Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

* Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
* Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 1000`
