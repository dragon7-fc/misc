2418. Sort the People

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `i`th person.

Return `names` sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == names.length == heights.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^3`
* `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
* `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
* All the values of `heights` are distinct.

        vector<pair<int, string>> v;
		// by putting height at first, we can skip writing a comparator as it'll sort by first element of the pair

		// sort in decreasing order
        sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());
		// build the final ans. x.second is the name.
        for (auto & x : v) ans.push_back(x.second);
        return ans;
