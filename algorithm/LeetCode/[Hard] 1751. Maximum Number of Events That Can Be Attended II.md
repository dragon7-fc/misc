1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II

You are given an array of events where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `i`th event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![1751_screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png](img/1751_screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60150-pm.png)
```
Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.
```

**Example 3:**

![1751_screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png](img/1751_screenshot-2021-01-11-at-60703-pm.png)
```
Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= events.length`
* `1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6`
* `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9`
* `1 <= valuei <= 10^6`

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up, Binary Search)**

**Explanation**

For each meeting,
find the maximum value we can get before this meeting starts.
Repeatly doing this K times.


**Complexity**

* Time O(knlogn), can be improved to O(nk) like Knapsack problem
* Space O(nk)
