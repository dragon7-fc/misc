1755. Closest Subsequence Sum

You are given an integer array nums and an integer goal.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return the minimum possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
Output: 7
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
* `-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
* `-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Binary Search)**

**Algo**

Divide nums in half. Collect subsequence subs of the two halves respectively and search for a combined sum that is closest to given target.
