1903. Largest Odd Number in String

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. Return the **largest-valued odd** integer (as a string) that is a **non-empty substring** of `num`, or an empty string `""` if no odd integer exists.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = "52"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = "4206"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = "35427"
Output: "35427"
Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num.length <= 10^5`
* `num` only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.

    def largestOddNumber(self, num: str) -> str:
        # We have to just find the last index of an odd number, then slice the number upto that index,  becuase an odd number always ends with a number which is not divisible by 2 :)
        
        # Lets take the last index of an odd number as -1
        last_ind = -1
        
        # Iterate through all the numbers for finding a odd number that appears on the last.
        for i , j in enumerate(num[::-1]):
            if(int(j) % 2 != 0):
                last_ind = len(num) - i
                break
        
        # If there is no odd number, return empty string.
        if(last_ind == -1): return ""
                
        # Or return the string upto that index.
        return(num[:last_ind])
```
