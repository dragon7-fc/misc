804. Unique Morse Code Words

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

```
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
```

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

```
Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
```

Note:

1. The length of words will be at most 100.
1. Each words[i] will have length in range [1, 12].
1. words[i] will only consist of lowercase letters.

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can transform each word into it's Morse Code representation.

After, we put all transformations into a set seen, and return the size of the set.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniqueMorseRepresentations(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        MORSE = [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.",
                 "....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.",
                 "---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-",
                 "...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]

        seen = {"".join(MORSE[ord(c) - ord('a')] for c in word) for word in words}

        return len(seen)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Time Complexity: $O(S)$, where $S$ is the sum of the lengths of words in words. We iterate through each character of each word in words.

Space Complexity: $O(S)$.
