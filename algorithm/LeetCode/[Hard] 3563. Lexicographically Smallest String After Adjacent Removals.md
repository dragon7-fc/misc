3563. Lexicographically Smallest String After Adjacent Removals

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

* Remove any pair of adjacent characters in the string that are consecutive in the alphabet, in either order (e.g., `'a'` and `'b'`, or `'b'` and `'a'`).
* Shift the remaining characters to the left to fill the gap.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** string that can be obtained after performing the operations optimally.

**Note**: Consider the alphabet as circular, thus `'a'` and `'z'` are consecutive.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc"

Output: "a"

Explanation:

Remove "bc" from the string, leaving "a" as the remaining string.
No further operations are possible. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string after all possible removals is "a".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bcda"

Output: ""

Explanation:

Remove "cd" from the string, leaving "ba" as the remaining string.
Remove "ba" from the string, leaving "" as the remaining string.
No further operations are possible. Thus, the lexicographically smallest string after all possible removals is "".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "zdce"

Output: "zdce"

Explanation:

Remove "dc" from the string, leaving "ze" as the remaining string.
No further operations are possible on "ze".
However, since "zdce" is lexicographically smaller than "ze", the smallest string after all possible removals is "zdce".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 250`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

Intuition
To efficiently find the lexicographically smallest result after all valid removals:
1. Precompute Removable Intervals

We mark every substring s[i..j] as removable if it can be entirely eliminated by repeatedly removing adjacent, alphabetically consecutive pairs.

Base case: any length-2 pair (i, i+1) is removable if s[i] and s[i+1] differ by 1 (with 'a'/'z' wrapping).

Build up to longer intervals by either:

. Removing the two ends (if they’re a valid pair) and checking the interior, or

. Splitting the interval into two smaller removable pieces.

2. Dynamic Programming on Suffixes

Let dp[i] be the lexicographically smallest string obtainable from the suffix s[i..n-1].

Option A: Keep s[i], then append dp[i+1].

Option B: For any j>i where s[i..j] is fully removable, skip directly to dp[j+1].

Choose the minimum of these options for each i from right to left.

3. Why It’s Optimal

By precomputing removability in O(n³) (with early exits and splits), and then doing a two-nested loop for DP, we cover all ways to drop removable chunks.

The DP guarantees we always pick the lexicographically smallest continuation, and the precomputation ensures no valid removal is overlooked.

Approach
1. Build the “removable” table

Initialize a 2D boolean array removable[n][n] to false.

Length-2 substrings: For each i, set removable[i][i+1] = true if s[i] and s[i+1] are alphabetically adjacent (with a↔z wrap).

Longer substrings: For len from 3 to n, and for each window [L..R] of that length:

i) If s[L] and s[R] are adjacent and removable[L+1][R-1] is true, mark [L..R] removable.

ii) Otherwise, try every split point k in (L..R): if both [L..k] and [k+1..R] are removable, mark [L..R] removable and break.

2. Suffix DP to choose removals optimally

Define dp[i] as the lexicographically smallest string you can get from the suffix s[i..n-1].

Base: dp[n] = "".

Fill dp backwards from i = n-1 down to 0:

i) Keep current char: candidate = s[i] + dp[i+1].

ii) Remove a removable block: for each j>i with removable[i][j] == true, candidate = dp[j+1].

iii) Set dp[i] to the lexicographically smaller of all candidates.

3. Return dp[0]

After filling, dp[0] holds the smallest string possible after all valid adjacent-consecutive removals.
Complexity
- Time complexity:

Building removable takes O(n³) in the worst case.

Computing dp takes O(n²) for the two nested loops.
Overall O(n³), which is acceptable for n ≤ 250.

- Space complexity:

O(n²) for the removable table and O(n²·avg_length) for storing dp strings, but in practice the memory is small enough to beat 100% of submissions.
