1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST

You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array trees (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

* Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.
* Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
* Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.

Return the `root` of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing `n - 1` operations, or `null` if it is impossible to create a valid BST.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:

* Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.
* Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.
A leaf is a node that has no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![1932_d1.png](img/1932_d1.png)
```
Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]
Explanation:
In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].
```
![1932_diagram.png](img/1932_diagram.png)
```
In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].
```
![1932_diagram-2.png](img/1932_diagram-2.png)
```
The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.
```

**Example 2:**

![1932_d2.png](img/1932_d2.png)
```
Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
Output: []
Explanation:
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].
```
![1932_diagram-3.png](img/1932_diagram-3.png)
```
The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.
```

**Example 3:**

![1932_d3.png](img/1932_d3.png)
```
Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible to perform any operations.
```

**Example 4:**

![1932_d4.png](img/1932_d4.png)
```
Input: trees = [[2,1,3]]
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: There is only one tree, and it is already a valid BST, so return its root.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == trees.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
* No two roots of trees have the same value.
* All the trees in the input are **valid BSTs**.
* `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 10^4`.

**Solution 1: (DFS, inorder)**

**Idea**

When asked to validate BST, we naturally think about in-order traversal (98. Validate Binary Search Tree). The question is how to do in-order traversal when we are given many separate trees.

First of all, we want to find a root node to start the traversal from, and we can do so by finding the node without any incoming edge (indeg = 0). If there's zero or more than one roots, we cannot create a single BST.

To traverse through nodes, we need to go from one BST to another. We achieve this with the help of a value-to-node map (nodes).

There are also two edges cases we need to check:

There is no cycle
We traverse through all nodes
Please see code below for more details =)
