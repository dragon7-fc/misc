1192. Critical Connections in a Network

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

![1192_1537_ex1_2.png](img/1192_1537_ex1_2.png)
```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
* `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
* There are no repeated connections.

    Nice Explanation:

    https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bridge-searching.html
    
    
    Idea is that an edge will be bridge if on its removal the remainder gets disconnected, but if the
    remainder portion has a back edge to a vertex that comes before the edge we are considering , then
    it wont be disconnected even if that edge is removed.
    
    a--b---c
    |------|
    
    We we reove a-b edge also, they will be connected because c has a back edge to a. 
    NOTE: the backedge should be <= b to be considered not a bridge edge.
