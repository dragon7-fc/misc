3288. Length of the Longest Increasing Path

You are given a 2D array of integers coordinates of length `n` and an integer `k`, where `0 <= k < n`.

`coordinates[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates the point `(xi, yi)` in a 2D plane.

An **increasing path** of length `m` is defined as a list of points `(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ..., (xm, ym)` such that:

* `xi < xi + 1` and `yi < yi + 1` for all `i` where `1 <= i < m`.
* `(xi, yi)` is in the given coordinates for all `i` where `1 <= i <= m`.

Return the **maximum** length of an **increasing path** that contains `coordinates[k]`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: coordinates = [[3,1],[2,2],[4,1],[0,0],[5,3]], k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

(0, 0), (2, 2), (5, 3) is the longest increasing path that contains (2, 2).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: coordinates = [[2,1],[7,0],[5,6]], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

(2, 1), (5, 6) is the longest increasing path that contains (5, 6).
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == coordinates.length <= 10^5`
* `coordinates[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^9`
* All elements in `coordinates` are **distinct**.
* `0 <= k <= n - 1`

**Solution 1: (Double LIS)**

The idea is simple: we sort points by x, and run the LIS algorithm for y.

Note that we run LIS separately for points on the left and lower of point k, and for points on the right and upper.

The tricky part is that we need to sort by x ascending, and by y - descending.

Say we have points [1, 1] and [1, 2]. LIS(2, 1) will correctly return 1 point, but LIS(1, 2) will return 2.

Why can't we keep the smallest of y for the same x?

If we do that, for points [1,1], [1,2], [2,1] and [2,2], we will keep (1, 1) y coordinates, and LIS(1, 1) will return 1.

However, LIS(2, 1, 2, 1) correctly returns 2.
