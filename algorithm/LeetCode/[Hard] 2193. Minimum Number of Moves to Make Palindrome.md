2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters.

In one **move**, you can select any two **adjacent** characters of `s` and swap them.

Return the **minimum number of moves** needed to make `s` a palindrome.

Note that the input will be generated such that `s` can always be converted to a palindrome.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can obtain two palindromes from s, "abba" and "baab". 
- We can obtain "abba" from s in 2 moves: "aabb" -> "abab" -> "abba".
- We can obtain "baab" from s in 2 moves: "aabb" -> "abab" -> "baab".
Thus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "letelt"
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the palindromes we can obtain from s in 2 moves is "lettel".
One of the ways we can obtain it is "letelt" -> "letetl" -> "lettel".
Other palindromes such as "tleelt" can also be obtained in 2 moves.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a palindrome in less than 2 moves.
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* `s` can be converted to a palindrome using a finite number of moves.
