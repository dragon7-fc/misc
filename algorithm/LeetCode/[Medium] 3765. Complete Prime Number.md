3765. Complete Prime Number

You are given an integer `num`.

A number `num` is called a **Complete** Prime Number if every **prefix** and every **suffix** of `num` is prime.

Return `true` if `num` is a Complete Prime Number, otherwise return `false`.

**Note**:

* A **prefix** of a number is formed by the first `k` digits of the number.
* A **suffix** of a number is formed by the last `k` digits of the number.
* Single-digit numbers are considered Complete Prime Numbers only if they are prime.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 23

Output: true

Explanation:

Prefixes of num = 23 are 2 and 23, both are prime.
Suffixes of num = 23 are 3 and 23, both are prime.
All prefixes and suffixes are prime, so 23 is a Complete Prime Number and the answer is true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 39

Output: false

Explanation:

Prefixes of num = 39 are 3 and 39. 3 is prime, but 39 is not prime.
Suffixes of num = 39 are 9 and 39. Both 9 and 39 are not prime.
At least one prefix or suffix is not prime, so 39 is not a Complete Prime Number and the answer is false.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = 7

Output: true

Explanation:

7 is prime, so all its prefixes and suffixes are prime and the answer is true.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num <= 10^9`
