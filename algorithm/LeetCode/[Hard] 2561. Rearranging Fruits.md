2561. Rearranging Fruits

You have two fruit baskets containing `n` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

* Chose two indices `i` and `j`, and swap the `i`th fruit of `basket1` with the `j`th fruit of `basket2`.
* The cost of the swap is `min(basket1[i],basket2[j])`.
* Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or `-1` if impossible.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.
```

**Constraints:**

* `basket1.length == bakste2.length`
* `1 <= basket1.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Counter)**

We count occurrences of each value in an ordered map.

> We use an ordered map so we do not need to sort numbers later.

We increment the count for the first basket, and decrement for the second.

If the final count is zero, the number of occurrences matches - no need to do any swaps with that number.

A positive (or negative) count means that there is extra of this number in the first (or the second) basket.

> Note that the count must be even, since we need to distribute it equaly between the baskets.

The total number of swaps can be determining by summing all positive (or negative) counts and dividit it by two.

Finally, we go from the smallest to the largest price (to minitize cost), and do the required number of swaps.

> Note that it may be cheaper to do two swaps with the cheapest fruit, that one swap with the current one.
