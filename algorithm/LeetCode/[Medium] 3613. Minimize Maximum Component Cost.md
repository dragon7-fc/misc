3613. Minimize Maximum Component Cost

You are given an undirected connected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` denotes an undirected edge between node `ui` and node `vi` with weight `wi`, and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to remove any number of edges from the graph such that the resulting graph has **at most** `k` connected components.

The **cost** of a component is defined as the **maximum** edge weight in that component. If a component has no edges, its cost is `0`.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the maximum cost among all components after such removals.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[3,4,6]], k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:
```

```
Remove the edge between nodes 3 and 4 (weight 6).
The resulting components have costs of 0 and 4, so the overall maximum cost is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5]], k = 1

Output: 5

Explanation:
```
![3613_minmax2.jpg](img/3613_minmax2.jpg)
```
No edge can be removed, since allowing only one component (k = 1) requires the graph to stay fully connected.
That single componentâ€™s cost equals its largest edge weight, which is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `1 <= wi <= 10^6`
* `1 <= k <= n`
* The input graph is connected.
