1776. Car Fleet II

There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array cars of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

* `positioni` is the distance between the `i`th car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
* `speedi` is the initial speed of the `i`th car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `i`th car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]
Output: [2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= cars.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= positioni, speedi <= 10^6`
* `positioni < positioni+1`

            # (where c1 is current car, c2 is the head of the stack and c3 is the car that c2 will collide with)
            # (if we have [[x1, s1], [x2, s2]], then collision time is (x2 - x1) / (s1 - s2))

                stack.pop()
            # if stack is empty, then current car will never collide with the next car
            if not stack:
                stack.append((position, speed, math.inf))
                result.append(-1)
            # find collision time and add the car to the stack
            else:
                collideTime = (stack[-1][0] - position) / (speed - stack[-1][1])
                stack.append((position, speed, collideTime))
                result.append(collideTime)

**Solution 2: (Stack, mono dec stack over time, backward)**

__Intuition__
There is some similar sense from the problem of 853. Car Fleet,
we care about the time information in front of each car.


__Explanation__
We care about the collision time of the cars in front us.
We iteratre from the last to the first car,
and we main a stack of car indices,
where their collision time is strict decreasing.

Imagine a,b,c on the road
if the a catches b later than b catched c,
then a won't catch b but b+c.


__Complexity__
Time O(n)
Space O(n)
