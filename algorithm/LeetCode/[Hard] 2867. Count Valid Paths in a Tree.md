2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the tree.

Return the **number of valid paths** in the tree.

A path `(a, b)` is **valid** if there exists **exactly one** prime number among the node labels in the path from `a` to `b`.

**Note** that:

* The path `(a, b)` is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node `a` and ending with node `b` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
* Path `(a, b)` and path `(b, a)` are considered the same and counted only once.
 

**Example 1:**

![2867_example1.png](img/2867_example1.png)
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
- (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2. 
- (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
- (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
It can be shown that there are only 4 valid paths.
```

**Example 2:**

![2867_example2.png](img/2867_example2.png)
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The pairs with exactly one prime number on the path between them are: 
- (1, 2) since the path from 1 to 2 contains prime number 2.
- (1, 3) since the path from 1 to 3 contains prime number 3.
- (1, 4) since the path from 1 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (1, 6) since the path from 1 to 6 contains prime number 3.
- (2, 4) since the path from 2 to 4 contains prime number 2.
- (3, 6) since the path from 3 to 6 contains prime number 3.
It can be shown that there are only 6 valid paths.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
* The input is generated such that `edges` represent a valid tree.
