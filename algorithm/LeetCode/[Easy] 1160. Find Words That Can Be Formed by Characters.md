1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
1. `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
1. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
