1092. Shortest Common Supersequence

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
* `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

* This is the same code for LCS that you're going to use it in this question as this demands the shortest common supersequence(We need this because the Dp table has the longest common subsequence stored in table). 
* If you think about it, the length of shortest common supersequence would be len(str1) + len(str2) - LCS. So what we are going to do is we would start from the last index of matrix and if we see that the elements are equal we are going to add them just once as they are LCS and if the elements are not equal then we add elements from both of them to find the required string.
