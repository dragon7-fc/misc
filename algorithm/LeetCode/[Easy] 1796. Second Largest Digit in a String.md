1796. Second Largest Digit in a String

Given an alphanumeric string `s`, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in `s`, or `-1` if it does not exist.

An alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
Output: 2
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abc1111"
Output: -1
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1]. There is no second largest digit. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.
