3171. Find Subarray With Bitwise AND Closest to K

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to find a **subarray**  of `nums` such that the **absolute difference** between `k` and the bitwise `AND` of the subarray elements is as small as possible. In other words, select a subarray `nums[l..r]` such that `|k - (nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] ... AND nums[r])|` is minimum.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the absolute difference.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,5], k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

The subarray nums[2..3] has AND value 4, which gives the minimum absolute difference |3 - 4| = 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2], k = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:

The subarray nums[1..1] has AND value 2, which gives the minimum absolute difference |2 - 2| = 0.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 10

Output: 9

Explanation:

There is a single subarray with AND value 1, which gives the minimum absolute difference |10 - 1| = 9.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Pruning)**

The AND value of a subarray is non-increasing.

We start from position i and track the AND value in val.

We also track the best result so far in res.

When val becomes less than k, and the difference is greater than res, we break.

This is because the absolute difference will staty the same or increase.

One problem with this approach is when we have many repeated values.

To counter that, we use the dp array. If we reach position j and val is less than it was before, we also break.

        int res = INT_MAX, dp[100001] = {};
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            for (int j = i, val = nums[i]; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
                val &= nums[j];
                res = min(res, abs(k - val));
                if (k - val >= res || val <= dp[j])
                    break;
                dp[j] = val;
            }
        return res;
    }
};
```
