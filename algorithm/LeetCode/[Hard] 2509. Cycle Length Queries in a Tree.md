2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree

You are given an integer `n`. There is a **complete binary tree** with `2^n - 1` nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value `1`, and every node with a value `val` in the range `[1, 2^(n - 1) - 1]` has two children where:

* The left node has the value `2 * val`, and
* The right node has the value `2 * val + 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where `queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. For each query, solve the following problem:

Add an edge between the nodes with values `ai` and `bi`.

Find the length of the cycle in the graph.

Remove the added edge between nodes with values `ai` and `bi`.

**Note** that:

* A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.

* The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.

* There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

 

**Example 1:**

![2509_bexample1.png](img/2509_bexample1.png)
```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]
Output: [4,5,3]
Explanation: The diagrams above show the tree of 23 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1,3]. Thus answer to the third query is 3. We delete the added edge.
```

**Example 2:**

![2509_aexample2.png](img/2509_aexample2.png)
```
Input: n = 2, queries = [[1,2]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree of 22 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1]. Thus answer for the first query is 2. We delete the added edge.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 30`
* `m == queries.length`
* `1 <= m <= 105`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= ai, bi <= 2n - 1`
* `ai != bi`
