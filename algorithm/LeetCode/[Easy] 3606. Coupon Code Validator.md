3606. Coupon Code Validator

You are given three arrays of length `n` that describe the properties of n coupons: `code`, `businessLine`, and `isActive`. The `i`th coupon has:

* `code[i]`: a **string** representing the coupon identifier.
* `businessLine[i]`: a **string** denoting the business category of the coupon.
* `isActive[i]`: a **boolean** indicating whether the coupon is currently active.

A coupon is considered **valid** if all of the following conditions hold:

* `code[i]` is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (`_`).
* `businessLine[i]` is one of the following four categories: `"electronics"`, `"grocery"`, `"pharmacy"`, `"restaurant"`.
* `isActive[i]` is `true`.

Return an array of the **codes** of all valid coupons, **sorted** first by their **businessLine** in the order: `"electronics"`, `"grocery"`, `"pharmacy"`, `"restaurant"`, and then by **code** in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: code = ["SAVE20","","PHARMA5","SAVE@20"], businessLine = ["restaurant","grocery","pharmacy","restaurant"], isActive = [true,true,true,true]

Output: ["PHARMA5","SAVE20"]

Explanation:

First coupon is valid.
Second coupon has empty code (invalid).
Third coupon is valid.
Fourth coupon has special character @ (invalid).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: code = ["GROCERY15","ELECTRONICS_50","DISCOUNT10"], businessLine = ["grocery","electronics","invalid"], isActive = [false,true,true]

Output: ["ELECTRONICS_50"]

Explanation:

First coupon is inactive (invalid).
Second coupon is valid.
Third coupon has invalid business line (invalid).
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == code.length == businessLine.length == isActive.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= code[i].length, businessLine[i].length <= 100`
* `code[i]` and `businessLine[i]` consist of printable ASCII characters.
* `isActive[i]` is either true or false.
