3235. Check if the Rectangle Corner Is Reachable

You are given two positive integers `X` and `Y`, and a 2D array `circles`, where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri`] denotes a circle with center at `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri`.

There is a rectangle in the coordinate plane with its bottom left corner at the origin and top right corner at the coordinate `(X, Y)`. You need to check whether there is a path from the bottom left corner to the top right corner such that the **entire path** lies inside the rectangle, **does not** touch or lie inside **any** circle, and touches the rectangle **only** at the two corners.

Return `true` if such a path exists, and `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: X = 3, Y = 4, circles = [[2,1,1]]

Output: true

```
The black curve shows a possible path between (0, 0) and (3, 4).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: X = 3, Y = 3, circles = [[1,1,2]]

Output: false

Explanation:
```
![3235_example1circle.png](img/3235_example1circle.png)
```
No path exists from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: X = 3, Y = 3, circles = [[2,1,1],[1,2,1]]

Output: false

Explanation:
```
![3235_example0circle.png](img/3235_example0circle.png)
```
No path exists from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= X, Y <= 10^9`
* `1 <= circles.length <= 1000`
* `circles[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Union Find)**

__Intuition__
The problem involves determining if there is a path from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of a rectangle, while avoiding any circles that obstruct the path. This can be visualized as a problem of connectivity in a graph, where we want to check if two points (the corners of the rectangle) belong to the same connected component while avoiding the circles.

__Approach__
* Initialization: Initialize a union-find data structure where each node represents a circle. Additionally, add two virtual nodes: one representing the bottom-left corner and another representing the top-right corner.

* Union Operations:

* For each circle, check if it touches the left or top boundary of the rectangle. If it does, union it with the bottom-left corner node.

* Similarly, if a circle touches the right or bottom boundary of the rectangle, union it with the top-right corner node.

* For each pair of circles, check if they overlap. If they do, union them.

* Check Connectivity: After performing all union operations, check if the bottom-left corner node is connected to the top-right corner node using the union-find data structure.
