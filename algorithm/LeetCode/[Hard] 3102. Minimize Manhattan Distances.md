3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances

You are given a **0-indexed** array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The distance between two points is defined as their **Manhattan distance**.

Return the **minimum** possible value for **maximum** distance between any two points by removing exactly one point.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[3,10],[5,15],[10,2],[4,4]]
Output: 12
Explanation: The maximum distance after removing each point is the following:
- After removing the 0th point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
- After removing the 1st point the maximum distance is between points (3, 10) and (10, 2), which is |3 - 10| + |10 - 2| = 15.
- After removing the 2nd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (4, 4), which is |5 - 4| + |15 - 4| = 12.
- After removing the 3rd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
It can be seen that 12 is the minimum possible maximum distance between any two points after removing exactly one point.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: It can be seen that removing any of the points results in the maximum distance between any two points of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= points.length <= 10^5`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8`

from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(points)
        points = [(x + y, x - y) for x, y in points]
        points.sort()
        xs = SortedList([x for x, y in points])
        ys = SortedList([y for x, y in points])
        res = float('inf')
        for x, y in points:
            xs.remove(x)
            ys.remove(y)
            res = min(res, max(xs[-1] - xs[0], ys[-1] - ys[0]))
            xs.add(x)
            ys.add(y)
        return res 
```

**Solution 2: (O(N))**

This is a classic problem to find the maximum Manhattan distance in O(n).

You can find many articles and solutions that explain how to do it.

Here, we just need to track two points that produce that maximum distance.

Then, we compute the maximum distance without the first, and without the second point, and return the minimum.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time: O(n)
* Memory: O(1)

> You can see other solutions that collect and sort sums and differences. Having all this information, we do not need to process points again.
However, the complexity is higher - O(n log n) runtime and O(n) memory, which is less efficient than going through the array 3 times.
