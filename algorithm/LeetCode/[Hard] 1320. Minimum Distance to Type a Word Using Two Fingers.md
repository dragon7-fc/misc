1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers

![1320_leetcode_keyboard.png](img/1320_leetcode_keyboard.png)

You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the XY plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate, for example, the letter **A** is located at coordinate **(0,0)**, the letter **B** is located at coordinate **(0,1)**, the letter **P** is located at coordinate **(2,3)** and the letter **Z** is located at coordinate **(4,1)**.

Given the string `word`, return the minimum total distance to type such string using only two fingers. The distance between coordinates `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`. 

Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so don't count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "CAKE"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is: 
Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
Total distance = 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "HAPPY"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "HAPPY" is:
Finger 1 on letter 'H' -> cost = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'H' to letter 'A' = 2
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = 0
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = Distance from letter 'P' to letter 'P' = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'Y' -> cost = Distance from letter 'A' to letter 'Y' = 4
Total distance = 6
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word = "NEW"
Output: 3
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: word = "YEAR"
Output: 7
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= word.length <= 300`
* Each `word[i]` is an English uppercase letter.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

Track the position of two fingers after tap the last character.

        for c in [ord(_) - ord('A') for _ in word[1:]]:
            for a, b in dp:
                dp2[c, b] = min(dp2.get((c, b), float('inf')), dp[a, b] + d(a, c))
                dp2[a, c] = min(dp2.get((a, c), float('inf')), dp[a, b] + d(b, c))
            dp, dp2 = dp2, {}
        return min(dp.values())

        def d(a, b):
            if a == -1: return 0
            return abs(a // 6 - b // 6) + abs(a % 6 - b % 6)

        def dp(first, second, currIndex):
            if currIndex >= N:
                return 0
            useFirst = d(first, ord(word[currIndex])-ord('A')) + dp(ord(word[currIndex])-ord('A'), second, currIndex + 1)
            useSecond = d(second, ord(word[currIndex])-ord('A')) + dp(first, ord(word[currIndex])-ord('A'), currIndex + 1)
            best = min(useFirst, useSecond)
            return best
        
        return dp(-1, -1, 0)
```

**Solution 3: (DP Bottom-Up)**

Assume we tap all letters with only finger.  
This is the upper bound of our distance tapping with two finger.

Now we can select some letter tapping with the second finger.  
We want to know what is the maximum that we can save.

`dp[i]` means that, the position of our second finger is at character `i`,
and the maximum we can save is `dp[i]`.

        word = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in word]
        dp = [0] * 26
        for b, c in zip(word, word[1:]):
            dp[b] = max(dp[a] + d(b, c) - d(a, c) for a in range(26))
        return sum(d(b, c) for b, c in zip(word, word[1:])) - max(dp)
