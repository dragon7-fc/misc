1728. Cat and Mouse II

A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a grid of size rows x cols, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

* Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat),`'M'`(Mouse).
* Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
* Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
* Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
* There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in grid.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

* Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
* During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
* `catJump`, `mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
* Staying in the same position is allowed.
* Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

* If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
* If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
* If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
* If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

![1728_sample_111_1955.png](img/1728_sample_111_1955.png)
```
Input: grid = ["####F","#C...","M...."], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.
```

**Example 2:**

![1728_sample_2_1955.png](img/1728_sample_2_1955.png)
```
Input: grid = ["M.C...F"], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = ["M.C...F"], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = ["C...#","...#F","....#","M...."], catJump = 2, mouseJump = 5
Output: false
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: grid = [".M...","..#..","#..#.","C#.#.","...#F"], catJump = 3, mouseJump = 1
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* r`ows == grid.length`
* `cols = grid[i].length`
* `1 <= rows, cols <= 8`
* `grid[i][j]` consist only of characters `'C'`, `'M'`, `'F'`, `'.'`, and `'#'`.
* There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in grid.
* `1 <= catJump, mouseJump <= 8`
