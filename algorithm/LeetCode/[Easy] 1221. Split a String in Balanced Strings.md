1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string `s` split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
1. `s[i] = 'L' or 'R'`
