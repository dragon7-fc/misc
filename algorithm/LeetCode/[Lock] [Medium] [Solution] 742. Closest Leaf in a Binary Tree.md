742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree **where every node has a unique value**, and a target key `k`, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target `k` in the tree.

Here, nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row. The actual root tree given will be a TreeNode object.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

Output: 2 (or 3)

Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
root = [1], k = 1
Output: 1

Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

Output: 3
Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
```

**Note:**

* root represents a binary tree with at least `1` node and at most `1000` nodes.
* Every node has a unique node.val in range` [1, 1000]`.
* There exists some node in the given binary tree for which `node.val == k`.
