1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` alternating.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1111"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 104`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
