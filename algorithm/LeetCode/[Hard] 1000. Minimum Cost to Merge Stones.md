1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row.  The `i`-th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging **exactly** `K` **consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
* `2 <= K <= 30`
* `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`
