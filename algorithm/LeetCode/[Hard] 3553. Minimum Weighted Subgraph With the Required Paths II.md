3553. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths II

You are given an undirected weighted tree with n nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array edges of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight `wi`.​

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [src1j, src2j, destj]`.

Return an array answer of length equal to `queries.length`, where `answer[j]` is the minimum total weight of a subtree such that it is possible to reach `destj` from both `src1j` and `src2j` using edges in this subtree.

A **subtree** here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]

Output: [12,11]

Explanation:

The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.
```

```
answer[0]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 2 and src2 = 3 to dest = 4 is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12.

answer[1]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 2 to dest = 5 is 2 + 3 + 6 = 11.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]

Output: [15]

Explanation:
```

```
answer[0]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 1 to dest = 2 is 8 + 7 = 15.
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `1 <= wi <= 10^4`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
* `queries[j].length == 3`
* `0 <= src1j, src2j, destj < n`
* `src1j`, `src2j`, and `destj` are pairwise distinct.
* The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

**Solution 1: (DFS)**

Intuition
In a tree, there is exactly one unique path between any two nodes. To form the smallest connected subtree that includes src1, src2, and dest, we need to include the union of all paths between these nodes. This subtree is essentially the union of paths src1 → dest, src2 → dest, and src1 → src2. The smallest subtree covering all three is equivalent to the sum of these three paths divided by 2 (since the common parts are double-counted).
Approach
Build the Tree: Represent the tree using an adjacency list with node-weight pairs.
Preprocessing with DFS:
Run a DFS to calculate the level and total weight from the root to each node.
Also compute the 2^i-th ancestors of each node for LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) queries using Binary Lifting.
Answering Queries:
For each query [src1, src2, dest], calculate:
Distance from src1 to dest
Distance from src2 to dest
Distance from src1 to src2
The total weight of the minimal subtree is the average of the sum of these three distances (divided by 2).
Complexity
Time complexity: O((n+q)logn)
Preprocessing (DFS + Binary Lifting): O(nlogn)
Each LCA query: O(logn)
Each distance calculation (3 per query): O(logn)
Total for q queries: O(qlogn)
Space complexity: O(nlogn)
