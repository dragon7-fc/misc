3559. Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either **1** or **2**.

The **cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui, vi]`, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges in the **path** such that the cost of the path between `ui` and `vi` is **odd**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply **modulo** `10^9 + 7` to each answer[i].

**Note**: For each query, disregard all edges not in the path between node `ui` and `vi`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

Query [1,1]: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.
Query [1,2]: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (1 → 2). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![3359_screenshot-2025-03-24-at-055820.png](img/3359_screenshot-2025-03-24-at-055820.png)
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]

Output: [2,1,4]

Explanation:

Query [1,4]: The path from Node 1 to Node 4 consists of two edges (1 → 3 and 3 → 4). Assigning weights (1,2) or (2,1) results in an odd cost. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 2.
Query [3,4]: The path from Node 3 to Node 4 consists of one edge (3 → 4). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
Query [2,5]: The path from Node 2 to Node 5 consists of three edges (2 → 1, 1 → 3, and 3 → 5). Assigning (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), or (1,1,1) makes the cost odd. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
* `queries[i] == [ui, vi]`
* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
* `edges` represents a valid tree.

**Solution 1: (DFS)**

Intuition
We are given a tree rooted at node 1 and need to answer multiple queries of the form (u, v), asking how many ways we can assign weights (1 or 2) to the edges in the path from u to v such that the total cost is odd.

The key insight is that for any path of length d (number of edges), the number of ways to assign weights 1 or 2 such that the sum is odd is exactly (2^{d-1}). This is because each edge can independently be 1 or 2, so there are (2^d) total combinations, and exactly half of them will be odd.

Approach
Construct the tree from the given edges.
Use DFS to calculate:
Level of each node.
First ancestor (for LCA prep).
Precompute the LCA table using binary lifting.
For each query:
Compute the distance (number of edges) between u and v.
If the distance is 0, return 0 (no path).
Otherwise, return (2^{d-1} % (10^9+7)).
Count the number of binary strings of length d using weights 1 and 2 such that their sum is odd.
Let’s say:
k of the d edges are assigned 1, and
d - k are assigned 2
Then total cost = 1 * k + 2 * (d - k) = 2 * d - k, and you want this to be odd.
That means 2 * d - k is odd ⇒ k is odd.
So, the answer is : Number of ways to choose an odd number of edges out of d to assign weight 1.
Σ (C(d, k)) for all odd k in [1, d]
Each edge can be 1 or 2 ⇒ total (2^d) combinations.
Half of them will result in an odd total ⇒ Answer is (2^{d-1}).
Complexity
Time complexity:

Preprocessing DFS: O(n)
LCA table initialization: O(n * log n)
Each query: O(log n)
Total: O(n * log n + q * log n)
Space complexity:

O(n * log n) for LCA table and graph.
