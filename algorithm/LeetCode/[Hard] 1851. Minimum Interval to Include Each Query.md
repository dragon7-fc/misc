1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `i`th interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` **(inclusive)**. The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `j`th query is the size of the **smallest** interval `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return an array containing the answers to the queries.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^7`
* `1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7`
