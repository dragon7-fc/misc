1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `i`th item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the `i`th item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the minimum index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 500`
* `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^3`
