303. Range Sum Query - Immutable

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

**Note:**

* You may assume that the array does not change.
* There are many calls to sumRange function.

# Solution

## Approach #1 (Brute Force) [Time Limit Exceeded]
Each time sumRange is called, we use a for loop to sum each individual element from index $i$ to $j$.

```java
private int[] data;

public NumArray(int[] nums) {
    data = nums;
}

public int sumRange(int i, int j) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
        sum += data[k];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Complexity analysis:**

* Time complexity : $O(n)$ time per query. Each sumRange query takes $O(n)$ time.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$. Note that data is a reference to nums and is not a copy of it.

## Approach #2 (Caching) [Accepted]
Imagine that sumRange is called one thousand times with the exact same arguments. How could we speed that up?

We could trade in extra space for speed. By pre-computing all range sum possibilities and store its results in a hash table, we can speed up the query to constant time.

```java
public NumArray(int[] nums) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            sum += nums[j];
            map.put(Pair.create(i, j), sum);
        }
    }
}

public int sumRange(int i, int j) {
    return map.get(Pair.create(i, j));
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $O(1)$ time per query, $O(n^2)$ time pre-computation. The pre-computation done in the constructor takes $O(n^2)$ time. Each sumRange query's time complexity is $O(1)$ as the hash table's look up operation is constant time.

* Space complexity : $O(n^2)$. The extra space required is $O(n^2)$ as there are $n$ candidates for both $i$ and $j$.

## Approach #3 (Caching) [Accepted]
The above approach takes a lot of space, could we optimize it?

Imagine that we pre-compute the cummulative sum from index $0$ to $k$. Could we use this information to derive $Sum(i, j)$?

Let us define $sum[k]$ as the cumulative sum for $nums[0 \cdots k-1]$ (inclusive):

$sum[k] = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}nums[i] & , k > 0 \\ 0 &, k = 0 \end{array} \right.$
 

Now, we can calculate sumRange as following:

$sumRange(i, j) = sum[j + 1] - sum[i]$

```java
private int[] sum;

public NumArray(int[] nums) {
    sum = new int[nums.length + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum[i + 1] = sum[i] + nums[i];
    }
}

public int sumRange(int i, int j) {
    return sum[j + 1] - sum[i];
}
```

Notice in the code above we inserted a dummy 0 as the first element in the sum array. This trick saves us from an extra conditional check in sumRange function.

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $O(1)$ time per query, $O(n)$ time pre-computation. Since the cumulative sum is cached, each sumRange query can be calculated in $O(1)$ time.

* Space complexity : $O(n)$.
