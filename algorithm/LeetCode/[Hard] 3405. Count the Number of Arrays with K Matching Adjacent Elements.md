3405. Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, `k`. A **good** array `arr` of size `n` is defined as follows:

* Each element in `arr` is in the inclusive range `[1, m]`.
* Exactly `k` indices `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) satisfy the condition `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

Return the number of **good arrays** that can be formed.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, m = 2, k = 1

Output: 4

Explanation:

There are 4 good arrays. They are [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 1].
Hence, the answer is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, m = 2, k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

The good arrays are [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 2, 1].
Hence, the answer is 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 5, m = 2, k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

The good arrays are [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Hence, the answer is 2.
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= m <= 10^5`
* `0 <= k <= n - 1`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

Construct a sequence with no mathcing adjacent elements:

Pick the 1st element has m choices
Pick other element has m - 1 choices (different from its previous)
This part has m * (m - 1) ** (n - k - 1) different array.
From a sequence of length n,
pick k element to be the matching adjacent elements,
there are n - 1 candidates (except arr[0]),
This part has combinations(n - 1, k) different ways.

Multiply the result of two parts.
