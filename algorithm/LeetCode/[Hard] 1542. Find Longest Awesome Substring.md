1542. Find Longest Awesome Substring

Given a string `s`. An awesome substring is a non-empty substring of `s` such that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it palindrome.

Return the length of the maximum length awesome substring of `s`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "3242415"
Output: 5
Explanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "12345678"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "213123"
Output: 6
Explanation: "213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "00"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists only of digits.

**Intuition**

Similar to 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts.


**Explanation**

* We have 10 + 1 types of palindromes.
* Use any number as the middle character, or don't have a middle character.


**Complexity**

* Time O(10N)
* Space O(1024)

        seen = [-1] + [n] * 1024
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            cur ^= 1 << int(c)
            for a in range(10):
                res = max(res, i - seen[cur ^ (1 << a)])
            res = max(res, i - seen[cur])
            seen[cur] = min(seen[cur], i)
        return res
