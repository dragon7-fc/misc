3692. Majority Frequency Characters

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

The frequency group for a value `k` is the set of characters that appear exactly `k` times in `s`.

The **majority frequency group** is the frequency group that contains the largest number of distinct characters.

Return a string containing all characters in the majority frequency group, in any order. If two or more frequency groups tie for that largest size, pick the group whose frequency `k` is larger.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aaabbbccdddde"

Output: "ab"

Explanation:

Frequency (k)	Distinct characters in group	Group size	Majority?
4	{d}	1	No
3	{a, b}	2	Yes
2	{c}	1	No
1	{e}	1	No
Both characters 'a' and 'b' share the same frequency 3, they are in the majority frequency group. "ba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcd"

Output: "abcd"

Explanation:

Frequency (k)	Distinct characters in group	Group size	Majority?
1	{a, b, c, d}	4	Yes
All characters share the same frequency 1, they are all in the majority frequency group.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pfpfgi"

Output: "fp"

Explanation:

Frequency (k)	Distinct characters in group	Group size	Majority?
2	{p, f}	2	Yes
1	{g, i}	2	No (tied size, lower frequency)
Both characters 'p' and 'f' share the same frequency 2, they are in the majority frequency group. There is a tie in group size with frequency 1, but we pick the higher frequency: 2.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
