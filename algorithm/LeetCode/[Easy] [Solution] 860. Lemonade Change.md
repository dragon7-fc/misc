860. Lemonade Change

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs \$`5`. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by `bills`).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a \$`5`, \`$10`, or \$`20` bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays `\$5`.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return `true` if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [10,10]
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
```

**Note:**

* `0 <= bills.length <= 10000`
* `bills[i]`will be either `5`, `10`, or `20`.

# Solution

## Approach 1: Simulation
**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's try to simulate giving change to each customer buying lemonade. Initially, we start with no five dollar bills, and no ten dollar bills.

* If a customer brings a `5` bill, then we take it. If a customer brings a `10` bill, we must return a five dollar bill. If we don't have a five dollar bill, the answer is `False`, since we can't make correct change.

* If a customer brings a `20` bill, we must return `15`.

    * If we have a `10` and a `5`, then we always prefer giving change in that, because it is strictly worse for making change than three `5` bills. Otherwise, if we have three `5` bills, then we'll give that.

    * Otherwise, we won't be able to give `15` in change, and the answer is `False`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* TimeComplexity: $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of `bills`.

âˆ— SpaceComplexity: $O(1)$.
