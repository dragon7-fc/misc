1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

Given a string `s`, return `true` if s is a **good** string, or `false` otherwise.

A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
