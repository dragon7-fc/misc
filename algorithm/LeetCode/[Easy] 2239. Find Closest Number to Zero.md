2239. Find Closest Number to Zero

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the number with the value **closest** to `0` in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the **largest** value.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

        });
