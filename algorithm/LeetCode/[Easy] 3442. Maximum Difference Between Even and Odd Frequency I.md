3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters in the string such that:

* One of the characters has an **even frequency** in the string.
* The other character has an **odd frequency** in the string.

Return the **maximum** difference, calculated as the frequency of the character with an **odd** frequency **minus** the frequency of the character with an **even** frequency.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
 

Constraints:

* `3 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
* `s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
