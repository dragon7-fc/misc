1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

You have a `grid of` size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: **Red**, **Yellow** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).

You are given `n` the number of rows of the grid.

Return the number of ways you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown:
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 54
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 246
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 7
Output: 106494
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length`
* `grid[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

**Key Note:**

* There are only two possibilities to form a non-adjacent row: **3 colors combination** (use all three colors, e.g., RYG) and **2 color combination** (use only two of three colors, e.g., RYR).
* We add the new row one by one. Apart from its inner adjacent relation, **every new added row only relies on the previous one row** (new added row is only adjacent with the row above it).
* **Every color combination follows the same pattern indicated below**. 3-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **two** 2-color combination for the next round. 2-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **three** 2-color combination for the next round.

* Let's try to have a math eqution to show the change above.
* The number of 3-color combination for round n is: **S(n)**. The number of 2-color combination for round n is **T(n)**.
* Thus, we can have two simple math equations reflecting the relation between current round (n) with next round (n + 1) for both 3-color-combination and 2-color-combination.

**S(n + 1) = 2 * S(n) + 2 * T(n)** 
**T(n + 1) = 2 * S(n) + 3 * T(n)**

**Solution 4: (DP Bottom-Up, level by level, summarize pattern)**

__Intuition__
Classic dynamic programming problem.


__Explanation__
Two pattern for each row, 121 and 123.
121, the first color same as the third in a row.
123, one row has three different colors.

We consider the state of the first row,
pattern 121: 121, 131, 212, 232, 313, 323.
pattern 123: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
So we initialize a121 = 6, a123 = 6.

We consider the next possible for each pattern:
Patter 121 can be followed by: 212, 213, 232, 312, 313
Patter 123 can be followed by: 212, 231, 312, 232

121 => three 121, two 123
123 => two 121, two 123

So we can write this dynamic programming transform equation:
b121 = a121 * 3 + a123 * 2
b123 = a121 * 2 + a123 * 2

We calculate the result iteratively
and finally return the sum of both pattern a121 + a123

            b121 = a121 * 3 + a123 * 2;
            b123 = a121 * 2 + a123 * 2;
            a121 = b121 % mod;
            a123 = b123 % mod;
