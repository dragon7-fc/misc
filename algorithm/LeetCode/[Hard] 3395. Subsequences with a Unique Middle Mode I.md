3395. Subsequences with a Unique Middle Mode I

Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of subsequences of size 5 of `nums` with a **unique middle mode**.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **mode** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the element that appears the **maximum** number of times in the sequence.

A sequence of numbers contains a unique mode if it has only one mode.

A sequence of numbers seq of size 5 contains a **unique middle mode** if the middle element (`seq[2]`) is a **unique mode**.

A **subsequence** is a **non-empty** array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output: 6

Explanation:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is the only subsequence of size 5 that can be formed, and it has a unique middle mode of 1. This subsequence can be formed in 6 different ways, so the output is 6. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

[1, 2, 2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 3, 4] each have a unique middle mode because the number at index 2 has the greatest frequency in the subsequence. [1, 2, 2, 3, 3] does not have a unique middle mode because 2 and 3 appear twice.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Output: 0

Explanation:

There is no subsequence of length 5 with a unique middle mode.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `5 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Counting each type of valid sequence)**

Idea: Fix the middle element and count the number of subsequences for each "type."

I have listed all the possible types in the comments above the corresponding code. We need to be careful to avoid double counting when counting subsequences that use the same element from either the left or the right and the other three elements are distinct.
