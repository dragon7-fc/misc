2954. Count the Number of Infection Sequences

You are given an integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `sick` which is sorted in **increasing** order.

There are `n` children standing in a queue with positions `0` to `n - 1` assigned to them. The array `sick` contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position `i` can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions `i - 1` and `i + 1` if they exist and are currently not infected. **At most one** child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.

It can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An **infection sequence** is the sequential order of positions in which **all** of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Note** that an infection sequence **does not** contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, sick = [0,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:
- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.
Now, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.
Finally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].
- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.
Now, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.
Finally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].
- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].
- The infection sequence is [3,2,1]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, sick = [1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Children at positions 0, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 3 possible infection sequences:
- The infection sequence is [0,2,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].
- The infection sequence is [2,0,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].
- The infection sequence is [2,3,0]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= sick.length <= n - 1`
* `0 <= sick[i] <= n - 1`
* `sick` is sorted in **increasing** order.

**Solution 1: (Stars and Bars)**

Consider X0000X (X denotes a sick kid):

2/4 kids can get sick at second 1: *X000X*
2/3 kids can get sick at second 2: *X00X*
2/2 kids can get sick at second 3: *X0X*
1/1 kid gets sick at the last second.
So, for the enclosed group of m kids, we can have 2 ^ (m - 1) possible sequences.

Now, for X0000X000X we have two enclosed groups:

2 ^ (4 - 1) = 8 sequences for the first group.
2 ^ (3 - 1) = 4 sequences for the first group.
Total, we have 8 * 4 = 32 sequences. However, for each sequence, we can also "interweave" kids (without changing their order):

* `****|||`
* `***|*||`
* `***||*|`
* `...`
* `|||****.`

The number of such combinations is a binomial coefficient of total kids n (start + bars), and kids in one group (bars): n! / (k! (n - k)!).

For the example above, 7! / (3! 4!) = 5040 / (6 * 24) = 35. The total number of sequences is 32 * 35 = 1120.

What about non-eclosed groups? The number of combinations in such groups are 1, but we still need to "interweave".

__Computing Inverse Modulo__

Binomial coefficients are tricky as factorials get super large super quickly. We can either generate Pascal Triangle, or pre-compute factorials and their inverse moduli.

The former requires a quadratic time and memory, so it's not suitable for this problem's constraints.

To compute inverse modulo we can use mod(x, -1, mod) in Python (3.8+), or a custom function modPow(x, mod - 2, mod) in C++.

(this formula is based on the Fermat's little theorem)

Modular power takes O(log n), and, since we pre-compute the entire range, we can use a DP-based formula to compute each value in O(1).

With the DP-based formula instead of modular power, the runtime drops from 50 to 18 ms.

long long factorial[100001] = {}, inv_factorial[100001] = {}, mod = 1000000007;
class Solution {
    int modPow(int x, int y, int m)
    {
        if (y == 0)
            return 1;
        long p = modPow(x, y / 2, m) % m;
        p = (p * p) % m;
        return y % 2 ? (p * x) % m : p;
    }
long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {
    return max(1LL, factorial[n] * inv_factorial[k] % mod * inv_factorial[n - k] % mod);
}
public:
    int numberOfSequence(int n, vector<int>& sick) {
        if (!factorial[1]) {
            long long inv[100001] = {};
            factorial[1] = inv[1] = inv_factorial[1] = 1;
            for (int i = 2; i <= 100000; ++i) {
                factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % mod;
                inv[i] = mod - mod / i * inv[mod % i] % mod;
                inv_factorial[i] = inv_factorial[i - 1] * inv[i] % mod;    
            }
        }
        long long res = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < sick.size(); ++i) {
            int group = sick[i] - sick[i - 1] - 1;
            res = res * modPow(2, max(0, group - 1), mod); // combine
            res = res % mod * binomial_coefficient(sick[i] - i, group) % mod; // interweave
        }
        return res * binomial_coefficient(n - sick.size(), n - sick.back() - 1) % mod;
    }
};
