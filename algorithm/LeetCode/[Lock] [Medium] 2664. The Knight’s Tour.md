2664. The Knightâ€™s Tour

Given two positive integers `m` and `n` which are the height and width of a `0`-indexed 2D-array board, a pair of positive integers `(r, c)` which is the starting position of the knight on the board.

Your task is to find an order of movements for the knight, in a manner that every cell of the board gets visited exactly once (the starting cell is considered visited and you shouldn't visit it again).

Return the array `board` in which the cells' values show the order of visiting the cell starting from 0 (the initial place of the knight).

Note that a knight can move from cell `(r1, c1)` to cell `(r2, c2)` if `0 <= r2 <= m - 1` and `0 <= c2 <= n - 1` and `min(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 1` and `max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 2`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 1, n = 1, r = 0, c = 0
Output: [[0]]
Explanation: There is only 1 cell and the knight is initially on it so there is only a 0 inside the 1x1 grid.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 4, r = 0, c = 0
Output: [[0,3,6,9],[11,8,1,4],[2,5,10,7]]
Explanation: By the following order of movements we can visit the entire board.
(0,0)->(1,2)->(2,0)->(0,1)->(1,3)->(2,1)->(0,2)->(2,3)->(1,1)->(0,3)->(2,2)->(1,0)
 
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n <= 5`
* `0 <= r <= m - 1`
* `0 <= c <= n - 1`
* The inputs will be generated such that there exists at least one possible order of movements with the given condition
