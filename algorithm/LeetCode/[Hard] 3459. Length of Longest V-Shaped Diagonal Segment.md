3459. Length of Longest V-Shaped Diagonal Segment

You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

A **V-shaped diagonal segment** is defined as:

* The segment starts with `1`.
* The subsequent elements follow this infinite sequence: `2, 0, 2, 0, ....`
* The segment:
    * Starts **along** a diagonal direction (top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right).
    * Continues the **sequence** in the same diagonal direction.
    * Makes **at most one clockwise 90-degree turn** to another diagonal direction while **maintaining** the sequence.

Return the **length** of the **longest V-shaped diagonal segment**. If no valid segment exists, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[2,2,1,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]

Output: 5

Explanation:
```
![3459_matrix_1-2.jpg](img/3459_matrix_1-2.jpg)
```
The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,2) → (1,3) → (2,4), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (2,4), and continues as (3,3) → (4,2).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,0,2,2,0],[2,0,1,1,0],[1,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation:
```
![img/3459_matrix_2.jpg](img/3459_matrix_2.jpg)
```
The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 4 and follows these coordinates: (2,3) → (3,2), takes a 90-degree clockwise turn at (3,2), and continues as (2,1) → (1,0).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,0],[2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,2,2],[2,0,0,2,0]]

Output: 5

Explanation:
```
![3459_matrix_3.jpg](img/3459_matrix_3.jpg)
```
The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 5 and follows these coordinates: (0,0) → (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) → (4,4).
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [[1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The longest V-shaped diagonal segment has a length of 1 and follows these coordinates: (0,0).
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length`
* `m == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= n, m <= 500`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0`, `1` or `2`.

__Explanation__
DFS with memo.
Current position (i, j),
the value to search x, where x = 0,1,2
the direction indice d, where direction is [[1,1],[1,-1],[-1,-1],[-1,1]]
and k is the time to turn.

__Complexity__
Time and Space O(m * n * 3 * 4 * 2)
