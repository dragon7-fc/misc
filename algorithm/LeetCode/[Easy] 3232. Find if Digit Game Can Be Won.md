3232. Find if Digit Game Can Be Won

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. In the game, Alice can choose **either** all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from `nums`, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is strictly greater than the sum of Bob's numbers.

Return `true` if Alice can win this game, otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,10]

Output: false

Explanation:

Alice cannot win by choosing either single-digit or double-digit numbers.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,14]

Output: true

Explanation:

Alice can win by choosing single-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 15.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [5,5,5,25]

Output: true

Explanation:

Alice can win by choosing double-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 25.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 99`
