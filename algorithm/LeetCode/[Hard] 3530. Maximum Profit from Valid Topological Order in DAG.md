3530. Maximum Profit from Valid Topological Order in DAG

You are given a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates a directed edge from node `ui` to `vi`. Each node has an associated score given in an array `score`, where `score[i]` represents the score of node `i`.

You must process the nodes in a **valid** topological order. Each node is assigned a **1-based position** in the processing order.

The **profit** is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.

Return the **maximum** possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.

A **topological order** of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge `u → v`, node `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], score = [2,3]

Output: 8

Explanation:

```
Node 1 depends on node 0, so a valid order is [0, 1].

Node	Processing Order	Score	Multiplier	Profit Calculation
0	1st	2	1	2 × 1 = 2
1	2nd	3	2	3 × 2 = 6
The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 2 + 6 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], score = [1,6,3]

Output: 25

Explanation:
```

```
Nodes 1 and 2 depend on node 0, so the most optimal valid order is [0, 2, 1].

Node	Processing Order	Score	Multiplier	Profit Calculation
0	1st	1	1	1 × 1 = 1
2	2nd	3	2	3 × 2 = 6
1	3rd	6	3	6 × 3 = 18
The maximum total profit achievable over all valid topological orders is 1 + 6 + 18 = 25.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == score.length <= 22`
* `1 <= score[i] <= 105`
* `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `edges[i] == [ui, vi]` denotes a directed edge from `ui` to `vi`.
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `ui != vi`
* The input graph is guaranteed to be a **DAG**.
* There are no duplicate edges.
