2413. Smallest Even Multiple

Given a **positive** integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both** `2` and `n`.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 150`
