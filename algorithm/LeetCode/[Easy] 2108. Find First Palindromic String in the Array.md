2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an **empty string** `""`.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

    return "";
