1463. Cherry Pickup II

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries. Each cell in `grid` represents the number of cherries that you can collect.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner `(0,0)` , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner `(0, cols-1)` of the grid.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots  by following the rules below:

* From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1, j+1).
* When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell (0).
* When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.
* Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.
* Both robots should reach the bottom row in the `grid`.
 

**Example 1:**

![1463_sample_1_1802.png](img/1463_sample_1_1802.png)
```
Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]
Output: 24
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.
Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.
```

**Example 2:**

![1463_sample_2_1802.png](img/1463_sample_2_1802.png)
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,0,0,1],[2,0,0,0,0,3,0],[2,0,9,0,0,0,0],[0,3,0,5,4,0,0],[1,0,2,3,0,0,6]]
Output: 28
Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.
Cherries taken by Robot #1, (1 + 9 + 5 + 2) = 17.
Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 3 + 4 + 3) = 11.
Total of cherries: 17 + 11 = 28.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,3],[0,0,0,3],[0,0,3,3],[9,0,3,3]]
Output: 22
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

* `rows == grid.length`
* `cols == grid[i].length`
* `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
* `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
