1462. Course Schedule IV

There are a total of `n` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have direct prerequisites, for example, to take course `0` you have first to take course `1`, which is expressed as a pair: `[1,0]`

Given the total number of courses `n`, a list of direct `prerequisite` pairs and a list of `queries` pairs.

You should answer for each `queries[i]` whether the course `queries[i][0]` is a prerequisite of the course `queries[i][1]` or not.

Return a list of boolean, the answers to the given `queries`.

Please note that if course `a` is a prerequisite of course `b` and course `b` is a prerequisite of course `c`, then, course `a` is a prerequisite of course `c`.

 

**Example 1:**

![1462_graph.png](img/1462_graph.png)
```
Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1 but the opposite is true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
Explanation: There are no prerequisites and each course is independent.
```

**Example 3:**

![1462_graph-1.png](img/1462_graph-1.png)
```
Input: n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: [false,true]
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 5, prerequisites = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], queries = [[0,4],[4,0],[1,3],[3,0]]
Output: [true,false,true,false]
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= prerequisite.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `0 <= prerequisite[i][0], prerequisite[i][1] < n`
* `prerequisite[i][0] != prerequisite[i][1]`
* The `prerequisites` graph has no cycles.
* The `prerequisites` graph has no repeated edges.
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
* `queries[i][0] != queries[i][1]`
