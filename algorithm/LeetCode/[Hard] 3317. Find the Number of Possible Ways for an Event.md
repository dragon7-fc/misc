3317. Find the Number of Possible Ways for an Event

You are given three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.

An event is being held for `n` performers. When a performer arrives, they are **assigned** to one of the `x` stages. All performers assigned to the same stage will perform together as a band, though some stages might remain empty.

After all performances are completed, the jury will award each band a score in the range `[1, y]`.

Return the **total** number of possible ways the event can take place.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note** that two events are considered to have been held **differently** if **either** of the following conditions is satisfied:

* **Any** performer is assigned a different stage.
* **Any** band is awarded a different score.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1, x = 2, y = 3

Output: 6

Explanation:

There are 2 ways to assign a stage to the performer.
The jury can award a score of either 1, 2, or 3 to the only band.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 5, x = 2, y = 1

Output: 32

Explanation:

Each performer will be assigned either stage 1 or stage 2.
All bands will be awarded a score of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3, x = 3, y = 4

Output: 684
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= n, x, y <= 1000`

**Solution 1: (Stirling, Math)**

Explanation
Enumerate the number of events a:

comb(x, a)
From x events, pick a events.

f(n, a)
Assign n performers to a events,
each event at least one performer.
Similar to Stirling number.

pow(y, a)
Each event can have score from 1 to y

There are comb(x, a) * f(n, a) * pow(y, a) for a events.

        res = 0
        for a in range(1, min(n, x) + 1):
            res += comb(x, a) * f(n, a) * pow(y, a, mod)
        return res % mod
