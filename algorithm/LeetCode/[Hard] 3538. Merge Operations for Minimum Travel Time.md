3538. Merge Operations for Minimum Travel Time

You are given a straight road of length `l` km, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and two integer arrays, `position` and `time`, each of length `n`.

The array position lists the positions (in km) of signs in **strictly** increasing order (with `position[0] = 0` and `position[n - 1] = l`).

Each `time[i]` represents the time (in minutes) required to travel 1 km between `position[i]` and `position[i + 1]`.

You **must** perform exactly `k` merge operations. In one merge, you can choose any **two** adjacent signs at indices `i` and `i + 1` (with `i > 0` and `i + 1 < n`) and:

* Update the sign at index `i + 1` so that its time becomes `time[i] + time[i + 1]`.
* Remove the sign at index `i`.

Return the **minimum** total travel time (in minutes) to travel from 0 to `l` after **exactly** `k` merges.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: l = 10, n = 4, k = 1, position = [0,3,8,10], time = [5,8,3,6]

Output: 62

Explanation:

Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and change the time at index 2 to 8 + 3 = 11.

After the merge:
position array: [0, 8, 10]
time array: [5, 11, 6]
Segment	Distance (km)	Time per km (min)	Segment Travel Time (min)
0 → 8	8	5	8 × 5 = 40
8 → 10	2	11	2 × 11 = 22
Total Travel Time: 40 + 22 = 62, which is the minimum possible time after exactly 1 merge.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: l = 5, n = 5, k = 1, position = [0,1,2,3,5], time = [8,3,9,3,3]

Output: 34

Explanation:

Merge the signs at indices 1 and 2. Remove the sign at index 1, and change the time at index 2 to 3 + 9 = 12.
After the merge:
position array: [0, 2, 3, 5]
time array: [8, 12, 3, 3]
Segment	Distance (km)	Time per km (min)	Segment Travel Time (min)
0 → 2	2	8	2 × 8 = 16
2 → 3	1	12	1 × 12 = 12
3 → 5	2	3	2 × 3 = 6
Total Travel Time: 16 + 12 + 6 = 34, which is the minimum possible time after exactly 1 merge.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= l <= 10^5`
* `2 <= n <= min(l + 1, 50)`
* `0 <= k <= min(n - 2, 10)`
* `position.length == n`
* `position[0] = 0` and `position[n - 1] = l`
* `position` is sorted in strictly increasing order.
* `time.length == n`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 100​`
* `1 <= sum(time) <= 100`
