519. Random Flip Matrix

You are given the number of rows `n_rows` and number of columns `n_cols` of a 2D binary matrix where all values are initially 0. Write a function `flip` which chooses a 0 value uniformly at random, changes it to 1, and then returns the position `[row.id, col.id]` of that value. Also, write a function `reset` which sets all values back to 0. **Try to minimize the number of calls to system's Math.random()** and optimize the time and space complexity.

**Note:**

* `1 <= n_rows, n_cols <= 10000`
* `0 <= row.id < n_rows and 0 <= col.id < n_cols`
* flip will not be called when the matrix has no `0` values left.
* the total number of calls to flip and reset will not exceed `1000`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
["Solution","flip","flip","flip","flip"]
[[2,3],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[0,1],[1,2],[1,0],[1,1]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
["Solution","flip","flip","reset","flip"]
[[1,2],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[0,0],[0,1],null,[0,0]]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has two arguments, n_rows and n_cols. flip and reset have no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

**Solution 1: (Random)**

nspired by @akaenki and Durstenfeld version Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle  
The baisc idea: flatten matrix to 1-d array; each time we filp a element, swap it with end of current array tail, and decrease the array size by 1; Therefore, we won't touch fliped elements and keep the flip uniformly  
Note: elements in the valid range of index array are untouched indexes; and each element is not related to indexes of index array
```
example: [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
step 1: flatten it to 1-d index array [0, 1, 2, 3|]; remain = 4
step 2: remain = 3; get a random index, say index = 0; 0 did not swap with other index; update swap[0] = 3 (current tail);
        index array [3, 1, 2,| 0] (index before | means untouched, afterwards means flipped); return [0 // 2, 0 % 2]
        the original matrix will be [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
step 3: remain = 2; get a random index, say index = 0 as before; 0 swapped with 3, thus actual index = 3; update swap[0] = 2 (current tail), which means swap elemnets of index 0 with element of index 2
        index array [2, 1,| 3, 0] (index before | means untouched, afterwards means flipped); return [3 // 2, 3 % 2]
        the original matrix will be [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
step 4: remain = 1; get a random index, say index = 0 as before; 0 swapped with 2, thus actual index = 2; update swap[0] = 1 (current tail), which means swap elemnets of index 0 with element of index 1
        index array [1,| 2, 3, 0] (index before | means untouched, afterwards means flipped); return [2 // 2, 2 % 2]
        the original matrix will be [[1, 0], [1, 1]]
step 5: remain = 0; get a random index, say index = 0 as before; 0 swapped with 1, thus actual index = 1; update swap[0] = 0 (current tail), which means swap elemnets of index 0 with element of index 0
        index array [|1, 2, 3, 0] (index before | means untouched, afterwards means flipped); return [1 // 2, 1 % 2]
        the original matrix will be [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
