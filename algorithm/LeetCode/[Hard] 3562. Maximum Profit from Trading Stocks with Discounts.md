3562. Maximum Profit from Trading Stocks with Discounts

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from 1 to `n`, and employee 1 is the CEO. You are given two **1-based** integer arrays, `present` and `future`, each of length `n`, where:

* `present[i]` represents the current price at which the ith employee can buy a stock today.
* `future[i]` represents the expected price at which the ith employee can sell the stock tomorrow.

The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array `hierarchy`, where `hierarchy[i] = [ui, vi]` means that employee `ui` is the direct boss of employee `vi`.

Additionally, you have an integer `budget` representing the total funds available for investment.

However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price `(floor(present[v] / 2))`.

Return the **maximum** profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.

***Note*:

* You may buy each stock at most **once**.
* You **cannot** use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from budget.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, present = [1,2], future = [4,3], hierarchy = [[1,2]], budget = 3

Output: 5

Explanation:
```

```
Employee 1 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 4 - 1 = 3.
Since Employee 1 is the direct boss of Employee 2, Employee 2 gets a discounted price of floor(2 / 2) = 1.
Employee 2 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 3 - 1 = 2.
The total buying cost is 1 + 1 = 2 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 2 = 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2, present = [3,4], future = [5,8], hierarchy = [[1,2]], budget = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:
```

```
Employee 2 buys the stock at price 4 and earns a profit of 8 - 4 = 4.
Since both employees cannot buy together, the maximum profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3, present = [4,6,8], future = [7,9,11], hierarchy = [[1,2],[1,3]], budget = 10

Output: 10

Explanation:
```

```
Employee 1 buys the stock at price 4 and earns a profit of 7 - 4 = 3.
Employee 3 would get a discounted price of floor(8 / 2) = 4 and earns a profit of 11 - 4 = 7.
Employee 1 and Employee 3 buy their stocks at a total cost of 4 + 4 = 8 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 7 = 10.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 3, present = [5,2,3], future = [8,5,6], hierarchy = [[1,2],[2,3]], budget = 7

Output: 12

Explanation:
```

```
Employee 1 buys the stock at price 5 and earns a profit of 8 - 5 = 3.
Employee 2 would get a discounted price of floor(2 / 2) = 1 and earns a profit of 5 - 1 = 4.
Employee 3 would get a discounted price of floor(3 / 2) = 1 and earns a profit of 6 - 1 = 5.
The total cost becomes 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 160`
* `present.length, future.length == n`
* `1 <= present[i], future[i] <= 50`
* `hierarchy.length == n - 1`
* `hierarchy[i] == [ui, vi]`
* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
* `ui != vi`
* `1 <= budget <= 160`
* There are no duplicate edges.
* Employee 1 is the direct or indirect boss of every employee.
* The input graph `hierarchy` is **guaranteed** to have no cycles.
