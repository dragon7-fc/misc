3600. Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades

You are given an integer `n`, representing `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1` and a list of `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`:

* `ui` and `vi` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.
* `si` is the strength of the edge.
* `musti` is an integer (0 or 1). If `musti == 1`, the edge **must** be included in the **spanning tree**. These edges cannot be upgraded.

You are also given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of upgrades you can perform. Each upgrade doubles the strength of an edge, and each eligible edge (with `musti == 0`) can be upgraded at most once.

The stability of a spanning tree is defined as the **minimum** strength score among all edges included in it.

Return the **maximum** possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is impossible to connect all nodes, return -1.

Note: A **spanning tree** of a graph with n nodes is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is connected) without forming any cycles, and uses exactly `n - 1` edges.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

Edge [0,1] with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
Edge [1,2] is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade.
The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6.
The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

Since all edges are optional and up to k = 2 upgrades are allowed.
Upgrade edges [0,1] from 4 to 8 and [1,2] from 3 to 6.
The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and 6.
The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible stability.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0

Output: -1

Explanation:

All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
* `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `ui != vi`
* `1 <= si <= 10^5`
* `musti` is either `0` or `1`.
* `0 <= k <= n`
* There are no duplicate edges.

**Solution 1: (Kruskal)**

Kruskal's
Greedily build a spanning tree using the next strongest edge; check for cycles using DSU.

Customizations
For this problem, we first include all "must" edges.

Also, we need to double k smallest included "non-must" edges.

Final Result
The final result is the minimum of:

weakest "must" edge
weakest non-doubled edge (n - 1 - k)
weakest edge multiplied by 2 (if k != 0)
