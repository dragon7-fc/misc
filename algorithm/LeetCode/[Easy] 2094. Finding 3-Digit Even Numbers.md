2094. Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers

You are given an integer array `digits`, where each element is a digit. The array may contain duplicates.

You need to find **all** the **unique** integers that follow the given requirements:

* The integer consists of the **concatenation** of **three** elements from `digits` in **any** arbitrary order.
* The integer does not have **leading zeros**.
* The integer is **even**.

For example, if the given digits were `[1, 2, 3]`, integers `132` and `312` follow the requirements.

Return a **sorted** array of the unique integers.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: digits = [2,1,3,0]
Output: [102,120,130,132,210,230,302,310,312,320]
Explanation: All the possible integers that follow the requirements are in the output array. 
Notice that there are no odd integers or integers with leading zeros.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: digits = [2,2,8,8,2]
Output: [222,228,282,288,822,828,882]
Explanation: The same digit can be used as many times as it appears in digits. 
In this example, the digit 8 is used twice each time in 288, 828, and 882. 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: digits = [3,7,5]
Output: []
Explanation: No even integers can be formed using the given digits.
``` 

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= digits.length <= 100`
* `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`

                ans.add(v)
        return sorted(ans)
