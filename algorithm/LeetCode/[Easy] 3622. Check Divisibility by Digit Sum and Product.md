3622. Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product

You are given a positive integer `n`. Determine whether `n` is divisible by the sum of the following two values:

* The **digit sum** of n (the sum of its digits).

* The **digit product** of n (the product of its digits).

Return `true` if `n` is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 99

Output: true

Explanation:

Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 23

Output: false

Explanation:

Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^6`
