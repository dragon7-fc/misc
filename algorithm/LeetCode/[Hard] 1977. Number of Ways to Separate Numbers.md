1977. Number of Ways to Separate Numbers

You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However, you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers. You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no** integer had leading zeros.

Return the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have written down to get the string `num`. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = "327"
Output: 2
Explanation: You could have written down the numbers:
3, 27
327
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = "094"
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: num = "9999999999999"
Output: 101
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num.length <= 3500`
* `num` consists of digits `'0'` through `'9'`.
