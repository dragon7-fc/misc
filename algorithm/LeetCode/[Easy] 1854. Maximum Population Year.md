1854. Maximum Population Year

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `i`th person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i`th person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.

Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
* `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`

    def maximumPopulation(self, logs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dates = []
        for birth, death in logs:
            dates.append((birth, 1))
            dates.append((death, -1))
            
        dates.sort()

        population = max_population = max_year = 0
        for year, change in dates:
            population += change
            if population > max_population:
                max_population = population
                max_year = year
