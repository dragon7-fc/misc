1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue

There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in **left to right order**. You are given an array `heights` of **distinct** integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the `i`th person.

A person can **see** another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is **shorter** than both of them. More formally, the `i`th person can see the `j`th person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the **number of people** the `i`th person can see to their right in the queue.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
Person 1 can see person 2.
Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
Person 3 can see person 4.
Person 4 can see person 5.
Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == heights.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
* All the values of `heights` are **unique**.
