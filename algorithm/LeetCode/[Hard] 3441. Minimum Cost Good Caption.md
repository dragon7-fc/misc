3441. Minimum Cost Good Caption

You are given a string `caption` of length `n`. A good caption is a string where every character appears in groups of **at least 3** consecutive occurrences.

For example:

* `"aaabbb"` and `"aaaaccc"` are good captions.
* `"aabbb"` and `"ccccd"` are not good captions.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an index `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) and change the character at that index to either:

* The character immediately before it in the alphabet (if `caption[i] != 'a'`).
* The character immediately after it in the alphabet (if `caption[i] != 'z'`).

Your task is to convert the given `caption` into a **good** caption using the **minimum** number of operations, and return it. If there are **multiple** possible good captions, return the **lexicographically smallest** one among them. If it is **impossible** to create a good caption, return an empty string `""`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: caption = "cdcd"

Output: "cccc"

Explanation:

It can be shown that the given caption cannot be transformed into a good caption with fewer than 2 operations. The possible good captions that can be created using exactly 2 operations are:

"dddd": Change caption[0] and caption[2] to their next character 'd'.
"cccc": Change caption[1] and caption[3] to their previous character 'c'.
Since "cccc" is lexicographically smaller than "dddd", return "cccc".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: caption = "aca"

Output: "aaa"

Explanation:

It can be proven that the given caption requires at least 2 operations to be transformed into a good caption. The only good caption that can be obtained with exactly 2 operations is as follows:

Operation 1: Change caption[1] to 'b'. caption = "aba".
Operation 2: Change caption[1] to 'a'. caption = "aaa".
Thus, return "aaa".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: caption = "bc"

Output: ""

Explanation:

It can be shown that the given caption cannot be converted to a good caption by using any number of operations.
```
 

Constraints:

* `1 <= caption.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `caption` consists only of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

__Approach__
The approach for this question is to start traversing from the back using a dp vector and looking for changes which would be the most cost-effective , where dp[i] stores the cost of changes upto i'th index.
We will also need to maintain a different vector to track the best way of transitioning to the elements earlier in the string to get the lexographically smallest result.
We need to simultaneously check whether the characters present have been present 3 times in a row or not.
But if you switch to the immediate character before or after , it would be really expensive!! Do you think you really have that type of money to afford that hahaha?
I don't think so. Therefore , while switching we can just go for the least expensive one after going through all changes out of 26 letters.
Lastly we can then just return the lexographically smallest string if we find multiple answers.
