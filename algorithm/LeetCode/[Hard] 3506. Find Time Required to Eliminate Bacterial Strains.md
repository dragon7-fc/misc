3506. Find Time Required to Eliminate Bacterial Strains

You are given an integer array `timeReq` and an integer `splitTime`.

In the microscopic world of the human body, the immune system faces an extraordinary challenge: combatting a rapidly multiplying bacterial colony that threatens the body's survival.

Initially, only one **white blood cell (WBC)** is deployed to eliminate the bacteria. However, the lone WBC quickly realizes it cannot keep up with the bacterial growth rate.

The WBC devises a clever strategy to fight the bacteria:

* The `i`th bacterial strain takes `timeReq[i]` units of time to be eliminated.
* A single WBC can eliminate only one bacterial strain. Afterwards, the WBC is exhausted and cannot perform any other tasks.
* A WBC can split itself into two WBCs, but this requires `splitTime` units of time. Once split, the two WBCs can work in parallel on eliminating the bacteria.
* Only one WBC can work on a single bacterial strain. Multiple WBCs cannot attack one strain in parallel.

You must determine the **minimum** time required to eliminate all the bacterial strains.

Note that the bacterial strains can be eliminated in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: timeReq = [10,4,5], splitTime = 2

Output: 12

Explanation:

The elimination process goes as follows:

Initially, there is a single WBC. The WBC splits into 2 WBCs after 2 units of time.
One of the WBCs eliminates strain 0 at a time t = 2 + 10 = 12. The other WBC splits again, using 2 units of time.
The 2 new WBCs eliminate the bacteria at times t = 2 + 2 + 4 and t = 2 + 2 + 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: timeReq = [10,4], splitTime = 5

Output:15

Explanation:

The elimination process goes as follows:

Initially, there is a single WBC. The WBC splits into 2 WBCs after 5 units of time.
The 2 new WBCs eliminate the bacteria at times t = 5 + 10 and t = 5 + 4.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= timeReq.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= timeReq[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= splitTime <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Heap)**

Here's the intuition used in this solution:
We kill the quickest dying bacteria in order to optimize the WBC overall time to split (kill-time plus splitTime). We do so using a priority queue.

Here's a trace of an example for the code below:

    popped bact    timeReq (splitTime = 4)
    ––––   ––––    ––––––––––––––––––
                   [ 2,10, 4, 5, 7, 4]    <-- initial timeReq
                   [ 2, 4, 4, 5, 7,10]    <-- heapify (timeReq)
      2            [ 4, 4, 5, 7,10]       <-- pop 2 (line 2)
      4      8     [ 5, 7, 8,10]          <-- while loop iteration 1      
      7      9     [ 8, 9,10]             <-- while loop iteration 2 
      9     12     [10, 12]               <-- while loop iteration 3
     12     14     [14]                   <-- while loop iteration 4
     18     18     [  ]                   <-- result is 18

    timeReq = [ 10,  4,  5], splitTime = 2
