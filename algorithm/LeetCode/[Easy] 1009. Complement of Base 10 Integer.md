1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation.  For example, `5` can be represented as `"101"` in binary, `11` as `"1011"` in binary, and so on.  Note that except for `N = 0`, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every `1` to a `0` and `0` to a `1`.  For example, the complement of `"101"` in binary is `"010"` in binary.

For a given number `N` in base-`10`, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-`10` integer.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
```

**Note:**

* `0 <= N < 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Math, String)**
```
Runtime: 28 ms
Memory Usage: 12.8 MB
```
```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
        bN = bin(N)[2:]
        bN = bN.replace('1','2')
        bN = bN.replace('0','1')
        bN = bN.replace('2','0')

        return int(bN,2)
```

**Solution 2: (Math)**

A binary number plus its complement will equal 111....111 in binary. Also, N = 0 is a corner case.
