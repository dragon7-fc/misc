2306. Naming a Company

You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

1. Choose 2 **distinct** names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.
1. Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB` with each other.
1. If **both** of the new names are not found in the original `ideas`, then the name `ideaA ideaB` (the **concatenation** of `ideaA` and `ideaB`, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
1. Otherwise, it is not a valid name.

Return the number of **distinct** valid names for the company.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ideas = ["coffee","donuts","time","toffee"]
Output: 6
Explanation: The following selections are valid:
- ("coffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee conuts".
- ("donuts", "coffee"): The company name created is "conuts doffee".
- ("donuts", "time"): The company name created is "tonuts dime".
- ("donuts", "toffee"): The company name created is "tonuts doffee".
- ("time", "donuts"): The company name created is "dime tonuts".
- ("toffee", "donuts"): The company name created is "doffee tonuts".
Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:
- ("coffee", "time"): The name "toffee" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- ("time", "toffee"): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- ("coffee", "toffee"): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ideas = ["lack","back"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no valid selections. Therefore, 0 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10`
* `ideas[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* All the strings in `ideas` are **unique**.

**Solution 1: (Group by First Letter)**

**Explanation**

Any idea = first letter + postfix string.
We can group all ideas by their first letter.

If two ideas `ideas[i]` and `ideas[j]` share a common postfix string,
then `ideas[i]` can not pair with any idea starts with `ideas[j][0]`
and `ideas[j]` can not pair with any idea starts with `ideas[i][0]`.


**Complexity**

* Time `O(n)`
* Space `O(n)`

        long long answer = 0;

                for (auto& ideaA : initialGroup[i]) {
                    if (initialGroup[j].count(ideaA)) {
                        numOfMutual++;
                    }
                }

                // Valid names are only from distinct suffixes in both groups.
                // Since we can swap a with b and swap b with a to create two valid names, multiple answer by 2.
                answer += 2LL * (initialGroup[i].size() - numOfMutual) * (initialGroup[j].size() - numOfMutual);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
