1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer `maxCost`.

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

            if maxCost < 0:
                maxCost += abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(t[i]))
                i += 1
        return j - i + 1
