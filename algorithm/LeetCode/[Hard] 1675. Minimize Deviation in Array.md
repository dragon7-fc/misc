1675. Minimize Deviation in Array

You are given an array nums of n positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

* If the element is **even**, **divide** it by `2`.
    * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2]`.
* If the element is **odd**, **multiply** it by `2`.
    * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4]`.

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.

Return the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [2,10,8]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
