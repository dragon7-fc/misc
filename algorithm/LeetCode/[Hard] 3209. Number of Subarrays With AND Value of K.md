3209. Number of Subarrays With AND Value of K

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **subarrays** of `nums` where the bitwise `AND` of the elements of the subarray equals `k`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 1

Output: 6

Explanation:

All subarrays contain only 1's.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2], k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

Subarrays having an AND value of 1 are: [1,1,2], [1,1,2], [1,1,2].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

Subarrays having an AND value of 2 are: [1,2,3], [1,2,3].
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Sliding Window, hash table)**

The AND value of a subarray is non-increasing. There are several problems that use this fact.

This is the recent problem, but LeetCode changed the description from AND to OR after the contest:
3171. Find Subarray With Bitwise AND Closest to K

For an element i, we track AND values (and their count) of subarrays [j..i] using a hash map.

If the value drops below k, we clear the hash map.
Note that we won't have more than 31 values in the hash map. This is because the number of bits in values is decreasing.

Example: if the first element is 63 (111111), and k = 7 (000111), we can have up to 4 values:

111111
011111, or 101111, or 110111.
001111, or 010111, or 001111.
000111.

__Complexity Analysis__

Time: O(n); for each element, we perform up to 31 operations.
Memory: O(1); we store up to 31 element.

        long long res = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            unordered_map<int, int> cnt1;
            if ((k & n) == k) {
                cnt1[n] = 1;
                for (auto [v, count] : cnt)
                    cnt1[v & n] += count;
                res += cnt1[k];
            }
            swap(cnt, cnt1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
