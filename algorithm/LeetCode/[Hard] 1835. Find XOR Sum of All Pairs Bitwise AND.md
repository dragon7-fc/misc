1835. Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND

The **XOR sum** of a list is the bitwise `XOR` of all its elements. If the list only contains one element, then its `XOR` sum will be equal to this element.

* For example, the **XOR sum** of `[1,2,3,4]` is equal to `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4`, and the **XOR sum** of `[3]` is equal to `3`.

You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `arr1` and `arr2` that consist only of non-negative integers.

Consider the list containing the result of `arr1[i] AND arr2[j]` (bitwise `AND`) for every `(i, j)` pair where `0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length`.

Return the **XOR sum** of the aforementioned list.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [6,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: The list = [1 AND 6, 1 AND 5, 2 AND 6, 2 AND 5, 3 AND 6, 3 AND 5] = [0,1,2,0,2,1].
The XOR sum = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr1 = [12], arr2 = [4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The list = [12 AND 4] = [4]. The XOR sum = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

__Intuition__
We all know the distributive property that `(a1+a2)*(b1+b2) = a1*b1 + a1*b2 + a2*b1 + a2*b2`

Now focus on each bit,
for example the last bit of A[i] and B[j],
and think how it works and affect the result.


__Explanation__
Distributive property is similar for AND and XOR here.
`(a1^a2) & (b1^b2) = (a1&b1) ^ (a1&b2) ^ (a2&b1) ^ (a2&b2)`
(I wasn't aware of this at first either)
