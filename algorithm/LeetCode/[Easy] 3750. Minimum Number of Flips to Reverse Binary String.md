3750. Minimum Number of Flips to Reverse Binary String

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Let `s` be the binary representation of `n` without leading zeros.

The reverse of a binary string `s` is obtained by writing the characters of `s` in the opposite order.

You may flip any bit in `s` (change `0 → 1` or `1 → 0`). Each flip affects exactly one bit.

Return the minimum number of flips required to make s equal to the reverse of its original form.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 7

Output: 0

Explanation:

The binary representation of 7 is "111". Its reverse is also "111", which is the same. Hence, no flips are needed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10

Output: 4

Explanation:

The binary representation of 10 is "1010". Its reverse is "0101". All four bits must be flipped to make them equal. Thus, the minimum number of flips required is 4.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^9`
