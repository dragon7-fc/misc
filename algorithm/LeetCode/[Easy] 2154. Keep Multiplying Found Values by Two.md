2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the first number that needs to be searched for in `nums`.

You then do the following steps:

1. If `original` is found in `nums`, multiply it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).
1. Otherwise, **stop** the process.
1. **Repeat** this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.

Return the **final** value of `original`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`
