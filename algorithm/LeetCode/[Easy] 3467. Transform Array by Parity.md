3467. Transform Array by Parity

You are given an integer array `nums`. Transform nums by performing the following operations in the exact order specified:

* Replace each even number with 0.
* Replace each odd numbers with 1.
* Sort the modified array in **non-decreasing** order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,1]

Output: [0,0,1,1]

Explanation:

Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (3 and 1) with 1. Now, nums = [0, 1, 0, 1].
After sorting nums in non-descending order, nums = [0, 0, 1, 1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,1,4,2]

Output: [0,0,1,1,1]

Explanation:

Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (1, 5 and 1) with 1. Now, nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
After sorting nums in non-descending order, nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
