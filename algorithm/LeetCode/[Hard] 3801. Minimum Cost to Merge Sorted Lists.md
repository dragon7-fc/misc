3801. Minimum Cost to Merge Sorted Lists

You are given a 2D integer array `lists`, where each `lists[i]` is a non-empty array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

You may repeatedly choose two lists `a = lists[i]` and `b = lists[j]`, where i != j, and merge them. The cost to merge a and b is:

`len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b))`, where `len` and `median` denote the list length and median, respectively.

After merging `a` and `b`, remove both `a` and `b` from lists and insert the new merged sorted list in any position. Repeat merges until only one list remains.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum total cost** required to merge all lists into one single sorted list.

The **median** of an array is the middle element after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the left middle element.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: lists = [[1,3,5],[2,4],[6,7,8]]

Output: 18

Explanation:

Merge a = [1, 3, 5] and b = [2, 4]:

len(a) = 3 and len(b) = 2
median(a) = 3 and median(b) = 2
cost = len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b)) = 3 + 2 + abs(3 - 2) = 6
So lists becomes [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]].

Merge a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and b = [6, 7, 8]:

len(a) = 5 and len(b) = 3
median(a) = 3 and median(b) = 7
cost = len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b)) = 5 + 3 + abs(3 - 7) = 12
So lists becomes [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]], and total cost is 6 + 12 = 18.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: lists = [[1,1,5],[1,4,7,8]]

Output: 10

Explanation:

Merge a = [1, 1, 5] and b = [1, 4, 7, 8]:

len(a) = 3 and len(b) = 4
median(a) = 1 and median(b) = 4
cost = len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b)) = 3 + 4 + abs(1 - 4) = 10
So lists becomes [[1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8]], and total cost is 10.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: lists = [[1],[3]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

Merge a = [1] and b = [3]:

len(a) = 1 and len(b) = 1
median(a) = 1 and median(b) = 3
cost = len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b)) = 1 + 1 + abs(1 - 3) = 4
So lists becomes [[1, 3]], and total cost is 4.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: lists = [[1],[1]]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The total cost is len(a) + len(b) + abs(median(a) - median(b)) = 1 + 1 + abs(1 - 1) = 2.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= lists.length <= 12`
* `1 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
* `-10^9 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^9`
* `lists[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
* The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed 2000.
