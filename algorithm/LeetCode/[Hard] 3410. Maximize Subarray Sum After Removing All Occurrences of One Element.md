3410. Maximize Subarray Sum After Removing All Occurrences of One Element

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **at most** once:

* Choose **any** integer x such that nums remains **non-empty** on removing all occurrences of `x`.
* Remove **all** occurrences of `x` from the array.

Return the **maximum** subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]

Output: 7

Explanation:

We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:

The original array is nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = -3 results in nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = -2 results in nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7.
Deleting all occurences of x = -1 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = 3 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]. The maximum subarray sum is 2.
The output is max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 10

Explanation:

It is optimal to not perform any operations.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

**Solution 1: (DP)**

__Intuition__
The main idea is to track the smallest prefix sum to compute the current best possible subarray sum while iterating the array.

Suppose we want to compute the sum of array[i...j] while delete all x in between, this shoud be:

prefix_sum[j] - (prefix_sum[i - 1] + (number of x in array[i...j]) * x)
We could view the right term as a modified prefix sum, which not only includes the original prefix sum, but also the sum of all deleted x among array[i...j].

__Approach__
Suppose we are currently at the index j,
let pre[x] be the smallest prefix sum with the sum of all x between the end of that prefix sum and the index j - 1.

We use pre[0] to represent no deletions here.

So, the best subarray ended at j should be prefix_sum[j] - lowest, where lowest is the smallest value in pre.

To update pre, we first check if array[j] is a negative value since deleting a positive number will never be the possible solution. (The spirit of Kadane!)

There are two items in pre affected:

pre[0]: don't delete array[j]

This means that we have nothing deleted in the prefix sum, and therefore we could just update pre[0] if the current prefix sum is smaller.

pre[array[j]]: delete array[j]

We choose the smaller value among the following conditions:

delete array[j] for pre[array[j]]
Follow the definition to include the current index j.

delete array[j] for pre[0]
This means that we restart from the previous smallest prefix sum with no deletions.

How can we make sure that there is no other array[j] in between?

Because if there is, pre[array[j]] should already include it and result in a smaller value in (a) to ignore (b).

Now, we successfully update pre for the next iteration.

        long low = 0;
        pre[0] = 0;

        for (auto n: nums) {
            prefix += n;
            res = max(res, prefix - low);

            if (n < 0) {
                if (pre.count(n)) {
                    pre[n] = min(pre[n], pre[0]) + n;
                } else {
                    pre[n] = pre[0] + n;
                }
                low = min(low, pre[n]);
            }

            pre[0] = min(pre[0], prefix);
            low = min(low, pre[0]);
        }

        return res;
    }
