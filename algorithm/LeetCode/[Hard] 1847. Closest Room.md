1847. Closest Room

There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei]` denotes that there is a room with room number `roomIdi` and size equal to `sizei`. Each `roomIdi` is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given k queries in a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]`. The answer to the `j`th query is the room number `id` of a room such that:

* The room has a size of at least `minSizej`, and
* `abs(id - preferredj)` is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.
If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is no such room, the answer is `-1`.

Return an array answer of length `k` where `answer[j]` contains the answer to the `j`th query.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]
Output: [3,-1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: rooms = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]], queries = [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [2,3]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.
Query = [2,4]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.
Query = [2,5]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == rooms.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `k == queries.length`
* `1 <= k <= 10^4`
* `1 <= roomIdi, preferredj <= 10^7`
* `1 <= sizei, minSizej <= 10^7`

**Solution 1: (Binary Search, Sort Queries)**

Our per-query time complexity should be better than O(n), so we will shoot for O(log n).

To do that, we need to binary search for our room in a list of rooms sorted by id. However, all rooms in that list should have an acceptable size. If we process our queries based on the room size, from largest to smallest, we can efficiently track the list of acceptable rooms.

We first sort our rooms and queries by the room size in the decreasing order. Then, for each query, we add acceptable rooms into a set (ids). We only process each room once, as our iterator (it) points to the largest room that is not yet in a set.

Finally, we binary-search for the closest id.

        vector<int> res(queries.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i)
            queries[i].push_back(i);
        sort(begin(rooms), end(rooms), by_size_desc);    
        sort(begin(queries), end(queries), by_size_desc);
        set<int> ids;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
            for (; j < rooms.size() && rooms[j][1] >= queries[i][1]; ++j)
                ids.insert(rooms[j][0]);
            auto it = ids.lower_bound(queries[i][0]);
            int id1 = it == begin(ids) ? -1 : *(prev(it));
            int id2 = it == end(ids) ? -1 : *it;
            res[queries[i][2]] = min(id1, id2) == -1 ? max(id1, id2) : abs(queries[i][0] - id1) <= abs(queries[i][0] - id2) ? id1 : id2;
        }
