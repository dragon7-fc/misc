3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K-th Stair

You are given a **non-negative** integer `k`. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the lowest stair numbered `0`.

Alice has an integer `jump`, with an initial value of `0`. She starts on stair `1` and wants to reach stair `k` using any number of operations. If she is on stair `i`, in one operation she can:

* Go down to stair `i - 1`. This operation cannot be used consecutively or on stair `0`.
* Go up to stair `i + 2^jump`. And then, `jump` becomes `jump + 1`.

Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair `k`.

Note that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair `k`, and performs some operations to reach the stair `k` again.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

The 2 possible ways of reaching stair 0 are:

Alice starts at stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Alice starts at stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: k = 1

Output: 4

Explanation:

The 4 possible ways of reaching stair 1 are:

Alice starts at stair 1. Alice is at stair 1.
Alice starts at stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
Alice starts at stair 1.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.
Alice starts at stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 20 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 21 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= k <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Combinations)**

__Intuition__
For each j = jump,
we can reach k that (1 << j) - j - 1 <= k <= 1 << j


__Explanation__
We have a = jump + 1 chance to go down,
and we need to go down b = (1 << jump) - k) times.
The ways here is combination(a, b)

Iterate jump from 0 to 40,
and accumulate the combinations.


__Complexity__
* Time O(32 * 32)
* Space O(1)

        long res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
            res = res * (n - i) / (i + 1);
        return res;
    }

        int res = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 31; j++)
            res += comb(j + 1, (1 << j) - k);
        return res;
    }
