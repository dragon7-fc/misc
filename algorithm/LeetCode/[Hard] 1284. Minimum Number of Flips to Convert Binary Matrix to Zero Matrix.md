1284. Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix

Given a `m` x `n` binary matrix `mat`. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.

Return the minimum number of steps required to convert `mat` to a zero matrix or `-1`if you cannot.

Binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to `0` or `1` only.

Zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to `0`.

**Example 1:**

![1284_matrix.png](img/1284_matrix.png)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Given matrix is a zero matrix. We don't need to change it.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: 6
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Given matrix can't be a zero matrix
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[0].length`
* `1 <= m <= 3`
* `1 <= n <= 3`
* `mat[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
