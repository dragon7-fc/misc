1001. Grid Illumination


On a `N x N` grid of cells, each cell `(x, y)` with `0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N` has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.  `lamps[i]` tells us the location of the `i`-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the `i`-th query `queries[i] = (x, y)`, the answer to the query is `1` if the cell `(x, y)` is illuminated, else `0`.

After each query `(x, y)` [in the order given by queries], we turn off any lamps that are at cell `(x, y)` or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)

Return an array of answers.  Each value `answer[i]` should be equal to the answer of the `i`-th query `queries[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 10^9`
* `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
* `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
* `lamps[i].length == queries[i].length == 2`
