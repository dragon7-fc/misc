1036. Escape a Large Maze

In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each grid square are `(x, y)` with `0 <= x, y < 10^6`.

We start at the `source` square and want to reach the `target` square.  Each move, we can walk to a 4-directionally adjacent square in the grid that isn't in the given list of `blocked` squares.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach the target square through a sequence of moves.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: blocked = [[0,1],[1,0]], source = [0,0], target = [0,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square, because we can't walk outside the grid.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: blocked = [], source = [0,0], target = [999999,999999]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Because there are no blocked cells, it's possible to reach the target square.
```

**Note:**

* `0 <= blocked.length <= 200`
* `blocked[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= blocked[i][j] < 10^6`
* `source.length == target.length == 2`
* `0 <= source[i][j], target[i][j] < 10^6`
* `source != target`

**Solution 1: (BFS)**

Based on Lee215's inspiration, but with some modifications. Ideas are below:

1. we can track the visited blocked, if all blocked are visited and BFS queue is not empty, then it means source is not trapped
1. if we have more alive nodes in our BFS queue than the count of non-visited blocks, then source is definitely not trapped.
1. using BFS depth as the termination condition is very time-consuming as BFS queue increases very quickly
