2876. Count Visited Nodes in a Directed Graph

There is a **directed** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and n directed edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** array `edges` where `edges[i]` indicates that there is an edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

Consider the following process on the graph:

* You start from a node `x` and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this **same** process.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the number of **different** nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

![2876_graaphdrawio-1.png](img/2876_graaphdrawio-1.png)
```
Input: edges = [1,2,0,0]
Output: [3,3,3,4]
Explanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:
- Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![2876_graaph2drawio.png](img/2876_graaph2drawio.png)
```
Input: edges = [1,2,3,4,0]
Output: [5,5,5,5,5]
Explanation: Starting from any node we can visit every node in the graph in the process.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == edges.length`
* `2 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= edges[i] <= n - 1`
* `edges[i] != i`
