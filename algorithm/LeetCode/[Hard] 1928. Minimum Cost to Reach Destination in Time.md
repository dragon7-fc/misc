1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time

There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array **edges** where `edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` denotes a road between cities `xi` and `yi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in `maxTime` **minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return the minimum cost to complete your journey, or `-1` if you cannot complete it within `maxTime` minutes.

 

**Example 1:**

![leetgraph1-1.png](img/1928_leetgraph1-1.png)
```
Input: maxTime = 30, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
Output: 11
Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.
```

**Example 2:**

![copy-of-leetgraph1-1.png](img/1928_copy-of-leetgraph1-1.png)
```
Input: maxTime = 29, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
Output: 48
Explanation: The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.
You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: maxTime = 25, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
* `n == passingFees.length`
* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
* `1 <= timei <= 1000`
* `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000` 
* The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
* The graph does not contain self loops.
