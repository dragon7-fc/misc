2083. Substrings That Begin and End With the Same Letter

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. Return the number of **substrings** in `s` that begin and end with the **same** character.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcba"
Output: 7
Explanation:
The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "c", "b", and "a".
The substring of length 3 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "bcb".
The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abcba".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abacad"
Output: 9
Explanation:
The substrings of length 1 that start and end with the same letter are: "a", "b", "a", "c", "a", and "d".
The substrings of length 3 that start and end with the same letter are: "aba" and "aca".
The substring of length 5 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "abaca".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The substring of length 1 that starts and ends with the same letter is: "a".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
