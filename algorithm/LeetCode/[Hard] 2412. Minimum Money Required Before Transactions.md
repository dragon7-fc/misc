2412. Minimum Money Required Before Transactions

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `transactions`, where `transactions[i] = [costi, cashbacki]`.

The array describes transactions, where each transaction must be completed exactly once in **some order**. At any given moment, you have a certain amount of money. In order to complete transaction `i`, `money >= costi` must hold true. After performing a transaction, `money` becomes `money - costi + cashbacki`.

Return the minimum amount of money required before any transaction so that all of the transactions can be completed **regardless of** the order of the transactions.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: transactions = [[2,1],[5,0],[4,2]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
Starting with money = 10, the transactions can be performed in any order.
It can be shown that starting with money < 10 will fail to complete all transactions in some order.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: transactions = [[3,0],[0,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- If transactions are in the order [[3,0],[0,3]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 3.
- If transactions are in the order [[0,3],[3,0]], the minimum money required to complete the transactions is 0.
Thus, starting with money = 3, the transactions can be performed in any order.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= transactions.length <= 10^5`
* `transactions[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= costi, cashbacki <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

**Intuition**

The worst case is losing all money first,
then we earn money later.


**Explanation**

First we calculate the sum of all money we can lose.
That is the sum of lost money is
sum_lose = sum(max(0, cost[i] - cashback[i]))

Assume before the last transaction thet lose money,
we have money = cost[i],
we spent all money as cost for this transaction,
we have no money left.
After transaction, we have money = cashback[i].

So the initial money is at least sum_lose + cashback[i]
and after all losing money,
we need at least max(cost[i]),
where cost[i] is the cost for all earning money transaction.

        }

    }
