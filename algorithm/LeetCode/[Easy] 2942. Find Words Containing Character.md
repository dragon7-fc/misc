2942. Find Words Containing Character

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

**Note** that the returned array may be in any order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 50`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
* `x` is a lowercase English letter.
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
