1278. Palindrome Partitioning III

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase letters and an integer `k`. You need to :

* First, change some characters of `s` to other lowercase English letters.
* Then divide `s` into `k` non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is palindrome.

Return the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc", k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aabbc", k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them are palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 8
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= s.length <= 100`.
* `s` only contains lowercase English letters.
