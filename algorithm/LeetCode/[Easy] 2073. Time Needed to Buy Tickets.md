2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets

There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0`th person is at the front of the line and the `(n - 1)`th person is at the **back** of the line.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `i`th person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.

Each person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy a ticket. A person can only buy **1 ticket at a time** and has to go back to **the end** of the line (which happens **instantaneously**) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will **leave** the line.

Return the **time taken** for the person at position k (**0-indexed**) to finish buying tickets.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: 8
Explanation:
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == tickets.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= tickets[i] <= 100`
* `0 <= k < n`

                secs += 1 # increase secs by 1

            i = (i + 1) % len(tickets) # since after getting to the end of the array we have to return to the first value so we use the mod operator
