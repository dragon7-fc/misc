2484. Count Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string of digits `s`, return the number of **palindromic subsequence**s of `s` having length `5`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note:**

* A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.
* A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "103301"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
There are 6 possible subsequences of length 5: "10330","10331","10301","10301","13301","03301". 
Two of them (both equal to "10301") are palindromic.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "0000000"
Output: 21
Explanation: All 21 subsequences are "00000", which is palindromic.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "9999900000"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only two palindromic subsequences are "99999" and "00000".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of digits.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

**Intuition**

To create a 5 digit palindrome we do not need to care about the middle element. We just need to find subsequence of pattern XY_YX. Calculate number of subsequences of type XY and subsequences of type YX around any given point i and multiply them to find number of subsequences of type XY_YX. Since string only has digits, the time complexity will be 100\*n.

**Approach**

We will be maintaing the counts of digit in the list cnts
Keep 2 arrays pre and suf to store the number of prefixes of type XY and suffixes of type YX. pre[i-1][1][2] means prefixes of type 12 before index i. Similarly suf[i+1][1][2] means suffixes of type 21 after index i
Remember given string is made of digits that is 0123456789. That's a total of 10 unique characters
Once we have calculated the prefix and suffix lists we just need to multiply pre[i - 1][j][k] with suf[i + 1][j][k] to find number of palindromic subsequences
```
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int c = s[i] - '0';
        if (i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
                for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
                    pre[i][j][k] = pre[i - 1][j][k];
                    if (k == c) pre[i][j][k] += cnts[j];
                }
        }
        cnts[c]++;
    }
```
Explanation of above code:
Use if (i) to not step outside of array limits when accessing pre[i-1]
Let's say j = 5, k = 4 and c = 4 which means we are looking at prefix 54. pre[i][j][k] = pre[i - 1][j][k] will carry forward previous count of prefixes. Since k == c means the current character(s[i]) matches with last digit of prefix. To find total number of possibilites of prefixes of type 54 we need to know how many 5 exist before current index. This information is stored in cnts[5]. So we add cnts[5] to pre[i][5][4].
