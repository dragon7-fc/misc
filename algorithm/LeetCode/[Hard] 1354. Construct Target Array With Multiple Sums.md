1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums

Given an array of integers `target`. From a starting array, A consisting of all 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

* let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
* choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < target.size` and set the value of `A` at index `i` to `x`.
* You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return `True` if it is possible to construct the target array from `A` otherwise return `False`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [9,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Start with [1, 1, 1] 
[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
[9, 3, 5] Done
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [1,1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: target = [8,5]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `N == target.length`
* `1 <= target.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= target[i] <= 10^9`

__Hint 1:__

Given that the sum is strictly increasing, the largest element in the target must be formed in the last step by adding the total sum in the previous step. Thus, we can simulate the process in a reversed way.

__Hint 2:__

Subtract the largest with the rest of the array, and put the new element into the array. Repeat until all elements become one

        heapq.heapify(target)
 
        while -target[0] > 1:
            num = -heapq.heappop(target)
            rest_sum = total - num
            if num < rest_sum or not rest_sum or (not num % rest_sum and rest_sum != 1):
                return False
            num %= rest_sum
            total = num + rest_sum 
            heapq.heappush(target, -num)
        return True
