1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums

Given an array of integers `target`. From a starting array, A consisting of all 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

* let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
* choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < target.size` and set the value of `A` at index `i` to `x`.
* You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return `True` if it is possible to construct the target array from `A` otherwise return `False`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [9,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Start with [1, 1, 1] 
[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
[9, 3, 5] Done
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [1,1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: target = [8,5]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `N == target.length`
* `1 <= target.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= target[i] <= 10^9`

            if curMax == 1:
                return len(target) == 0 or max(target) == -1
            total -= curMax
            nxt = curMax - total
            total += nxt
            if nxt < 1:
                return False
            heapq.heappush(target, -nxt)
