3272. Find the Count of Good Integers

You are given two **positive** integers `n` and `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-palindromic** if:

* x is a **palindrome**.
* x is divisible by k.

An integer is called **good** if its digits can be rearranged to form a **k-palindromic** integer. For example, for k = 2, 2020 can be rearranged to form the k-palindromic integer 2002, whereas 1010 cannot be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer.

Return the count of **good** integers containing `n` digits.

**Note** that any integer must **not** have leading zeros, **neither** before **nor** after rearrangement. For example, 1010 cannot be rearranged to form 101.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 5

Output: 27

Explanation:

Some of the good integers are:

551 because it can be rearranged to form 515.
525 because it is already k-palindromic.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1, k = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:

The two good integers are 4 and 8.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 5, k = 6

Output: 2468
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10`
* `1 <= k <= 9`
