2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum

Given a positive integer `num`, return the number of positive integers **less than or equal to** `num` whose digit sums are **even**.

The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num <= 1000`

            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum % 2 == 0 ? temp / 2 : (temp + 1) / 2 - 1;
    }
};
