3609. Minimum Moves to Reach Target in Grid

You are given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, representing two points `(sx, sy)` and `(tx, ty)` on an infinitely large 2D grid.

You start at `(sx, sy)`.

At any point `(x, y)`, define `m = max(x, y)`. You can either:

* Move to `(x + m, y)`, or
* Move to `(x, y + m)`.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required to reach `(tx, ty)`. If it is impossible to reach the target, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: sx = 1, sy = 2, tx = 5, ty = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:

The optimal path is:

Move 1: max(1, 2) = 2. Increase the y-coordinate by 2, moving from (1, 2) to (1, 2 + 2) = (1, 4).
Move 2: max(1, 4) = 4. Increase the x-coordinate by 4, moving from (1, 4) to (1 + 4, 4) = (5, 4).
Thus, the minimum number of moves to reach (5, 4) is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: sx = 0, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

The optimal path is:

Move 1: max(0, 1) = 1. Increase the x-coordinate by 1, moving from (0, 1) to (0 + 1, 1) = (1, 1).
Move 2: max(1, 1) = 1. Increase the x-coordinate by 1, moving from (1, 1) to (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1).
Move 3: max(2, 1) = 2. Increase the y-coordinate by 2, moving from (2, 1) to (2, 1 + 2) = (2, 3).
Thus, the minimum number of moves to reach (2, 3) is 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2

Output: -1

Explanation:

It is impossible to reach (2, 2) from (1, 1) using the allowed moves. Thus, the answer is -1.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= sx <= tx <= 10^9`
* `0 <= sy <= ty <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Reverse)**

__Intuition__
The solution works by reversing the moves from (tx, ty) back to (sx, sy).

__Explanation__
The core idea is to repeatedly apply the reverse operation,
that makes the larger coordinate smaller,
until either (sx, sy) is reached,
or it becomes clear that it's impossible.

At any point (x, y):
If x > y:
If x > 2y > y, (x, y) -> (x / 2, y)
If 2y >= x > y, (x, y) -> (x - y, y)

If y > x, similarly.
If x == y, it becomes (0, y) or (x, 0)

__Complexity__
Time O(logtx + logty)
Space O(1)
