2742. Painting the Walls

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, `cost` and `time`, of size `n` representing the costs and the time taken to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:

* A **paid painter** that paints the ith wall in `time[i]` units of time and takes `cost[i]` units of money.
* A **free painter** that paints **any** wall in `1` unit of time at a cost of `0`. But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already **occupied**.

Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the `n` walls.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 3 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 2 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 1 and 2, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= cost.length <= 500`
* `cost.length == time.length`
* `1 <= cost[i] <= 106`
* `1 <= time[i] <= 500`
