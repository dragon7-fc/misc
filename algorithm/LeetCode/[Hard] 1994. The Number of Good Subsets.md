1994. The Number of Good Subsets

You are given an integer array nums. We call a subset of nums good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers.

* For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`:
    * `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
    * `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return the number of different **good** subsets in nums modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A **subset** of nums is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3,15]
Output: 5
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`
