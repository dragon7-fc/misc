4036. Lexicographically Largest String After Pair Transformations

You are given an integer array `nums`.

For each integer `x` in `nums`, start with a string consisting of exactly `x` lowercase `'a'` characters.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

* Choose two **adjacent equal** letters and replace them with the next letter in the alphabet.

For example, `"aa"` can be replaced with `"b"`, and `"bb"` can be replaced with `"c"`. The pair `"zz"` cannot be replaced.

For each `x`, determine the **lexicographically largest** string that can be obtained.

Return an array of strings where the `i`th string is the answer for `nums[i]`.

A string `a` is **lexicographically** larger than a string `b` if, at the first position where they differ, `a` contains a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. If the first `min(a.length, b.length)` characters are equal, the longer string is lexicographically larger.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,7]

Output: ["b","ca","cba"]

Explanation:

nums[0] = 2: "aa" → "b".
nums[1] = 5: "aaaaa" → "baaa" → "bba" → "ca".
nums[2] = 7: "aaaaaaa" → "baaaaa" → "bbaaa" → "bbba" → "cba".
Therefore, ans = ["b", "ca", "cba"].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,9,1]

Output: ["ba","da","a"]

Explanation:

nums[0] = 3: "aaa" → "ba".
nums[1] = 9: "aaaaaaaaa" → "baaaaaaa" → "bbaaaaa" → "bbbaaa" → "bbbba" → "cbba" → "cca" → "da".
nums[2] = 1: No transformation can be applied, so the result is "a".
Therefore, ans = ["ba", "da", "a"].
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8`
