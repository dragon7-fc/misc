38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

* `1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
* `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
* `21` is read off as `"one 2, then one 1"`or `1211`.

Given an integer `n` where `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30`, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

**Note:** Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
