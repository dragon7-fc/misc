3449. Maximize the Minimum Game Score

You are given an array `points` of size `n` and an integer `m`. There is another array `gameScore` of size `n`, where `gameScore[i]` represents the score achieved at the `i`th game. Initially, `gameScore[i] == 0` for all `i`.

You start at index `-1`, which is outside the array (before the first position at index `0`). You can make at most `m` moves. In each move, you can either:

* Increase the index by 1 and add `points[i]` to `gameScore[i]`.
* Decrease the index by 1 and add `points[i]` to `gameScore[i]`.

**Note** that the index must always remain within the bounds of the array after the first move.

Return the **maximum possible minimum** value in `gameScore` after **at most** `m` moves.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [2,4], m = 3

Output: 4

Explanation:

Initially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0].

Move	Index	gameScore
Increase i	0	[2, 0]
Increase i	1	[2, 4]
Decrease i	0	[4, 4]
The minimum value in gameScore is 4, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations. Hence, 4 is the output.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [1,2,3], m = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

Initially, index i = -1 and gameScore = [0, 0, 0].

Move	Index	gameScore
Increase i	0	[1, 0, 0]
Increase i	1	[1, 2, 0]
Decrease i	0	[2, 2, 0]
Increase i	1	[2, 4, 0]
Increase i	2	[2, 4, 3]
The minimum value in gameScore is 2, and this is the maximum possible minimum among all configurations. Hence, 2 is the output.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n == points.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `1 <= points[i] <= 10^6`
* `1 <= m <= 10^9`
