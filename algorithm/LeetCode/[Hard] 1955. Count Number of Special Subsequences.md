1955. Count Number of Special Subsequences

A sequence is **special** if it consists of a **positive** number of `0`s, followed by a **positive** number of `1`s, then a **positive** number of `2`s.

* For example, `[0,1,2]` and `[0,0,1,1,1,2]` are special.
* In contrast, `[2,1,0]`, `[1]`, and `[0,1,2,0]` are not special.

Given an array `nums` (consisting of **only** integers `0,` `1`, and `2`), return the **number of different subsequences** that are special. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are **different** if the **set of indices** chosen are different.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The special subsequences are [0,1,2,2], [0,1,2,2], and [0,1,2,2].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,0,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no special subsequences in [2,2,0,0].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,0,1,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: The special subsequences are:
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 2`

**Solution 1: (DP, Bottom-Up)

**Explanation**

* `dp[0]` means the number of special sequence of `0`.
* `dp[1]` means the number of special sequence of `0,1`.
* `dp[2]` means the number of special sequence `0,1,2`.

```
Iterate each element a in the input A,

If a = 0, dp[0] += dp[0] + 1
Itself is a special sequence of 0,
and it extend all previous special sequence of 0.

If a = 1, dp[1] += dp[1] + dp[0]
Because, it extends all previous special sequence of 0.
and it extends all previous special sequence of 1.

If a = 2, dp[1] += dp[2] + dp[1]
Because, it extends all previous special sequence of 2.
and it extends all previous special sequence of 1.

In example 1, we have [0,1,2],
now A[3] = 2
[0,1,2] + [2] = [0,1,2,2]
[0,1] + [2] = [0,1,2]
So the answer is 2.
```

**Complexity**

* Time O(n)
* Space O(1)

        for a in nums:

        return dp[-1] % (10**9 + 7)
