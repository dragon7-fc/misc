2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the ranks of some mechanics. `ranksi` is the rank of the `i`th mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair n cars in `r * n2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars.

**Note:** All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: 
- The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
- The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
Output: 16
Explanation: 
- The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​​​​
``` 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= ranks.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= cars <= 10^6`
