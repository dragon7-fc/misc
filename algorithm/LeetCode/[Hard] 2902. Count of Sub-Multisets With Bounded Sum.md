2902. Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of non-negative integers, and two integers `l` and `r`.

Return the **count of sub-multisets** within `nums` where the sum of elements in each subset falls within the inclusive range of `[l, r]`.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A **sub-multiset** is an **unordered** collection of elements of the array in which a given value `x` can occur `0, 1, ..., occ[x]` times, where `occ[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the array.

**Note** that:

* Two **sub-multisets** are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results in identical multisets.
* The sum of an empty multiset is `0`.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3], l = 6, r = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only subset of nums that has a sum of 6 is {1, 2, 3}.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,1,4,2,7], l = 1, r = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [1, 5] are {1}, {2}, {4}, {2, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, and {1, 2, 2}.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,2], l = 3, r = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [3, 5] are {3}, {5}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, and {1, 2, 2}.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^4`
* Sum of nums does not exceed `2 * 10^4`.
* `0 <= l <= r <= 2 * 10^4`

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up, Knapsack)**

__Intuition__
Knapsack DP problem, where we can have multiple same item.


__Explanation__
In this Knapsack DP problem,
dp[i] is the ways to sum up i.
dp[0] = 1 for empty set,
and we want to find sum(dp[l] + ... + dp[r]).

Iterate all items,
assume we have c item of size a,
iterate i from r to 1,
update dp[i] += dp[i - a] + dp[i - a * 2] + ...+ dp[i - a * c].

Improve the process of calculation,
with idea of sliding window by keep the sum of
dp[i - a] + ... + dp[i - a * c]


__Complexity__
* Time O(rm)
* Space O(r)
where m is the number of different A[i],
(1 + m) * m / 2 <= sum,
so O(m) = O(sqrt(sum))
