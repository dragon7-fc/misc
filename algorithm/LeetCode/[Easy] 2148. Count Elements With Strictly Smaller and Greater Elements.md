2148. Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] > m && nums[i] < M) res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
