2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace **any** element in nums with **any** integer.

nums is considered **continuous** if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

* All elements in nums are **unique**.
* The difference between the **maximum** element and the **minimum** element in nums equals `nums.length - 1`.

For example, `nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]` is **continuous**, but `nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` is **not continuous**.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make `nums` **continuous**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums is already continuous.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,10,100,1000]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution is to:
- Change the second element to 2.
- Change the third element to 3.
- Change the fourth element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,4], which is continuous.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
