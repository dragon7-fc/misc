3757. Number of Effective Subsequences

You are given an integer array `nums`.

The strength of the array is defined as the bitwise OR of all its elements.

A **subsequence** is considered **effective** if removing that subsequence strictly decreases the strength of the remaining elements.

Return the number of effective subsequences in `nums`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The bitwise OR of an empty array is 0.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The Bitwise OR of the array is 1 OR 2 OR 3 = 3.
Subsequences that are effective are:
[1, 3]: The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
[2, 3]: The remaining element [1] has a Bitwise OR of 1.
[1, 2, 3]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [7,4,6]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The Bitwise OR of the array is 7 OR 4 OR 6 = 7.
Subsequences that are effective are:
[7]: The remaining elements [4, 6] have a Bitwise OR of 6.
[7, 4]: The remaining element [6] has a Bitwise OR of 6.
[7, 6]: The remaining element [4] has a Bitwise OR of 4.
[7, 4, 6]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [8,8]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The Bitwise OR of the array is 8 OR 8 = 8.
Only the subsequence [8, 8] is effective since removing it leaves [] which has a Bitwise OR of 0.
Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 1.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The Bitwise OR of the array is 2 OR 2 OR 1 = 3.
Subsequences that are effective are:
[1]: The remaining elements [2, 2] have a Bitwise OR of 2.
[2, 1] (using nums[0], nums[2]): The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
[2, 1] (using nums[1], nums[2]): The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
[2, 2]: The remaining element [1] has a Bitwise OR of 1.
[2, 2, 1]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
