3300. Minimum Element After Replacement With Digit Sum

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You replace each element in `nums` with the sum of its digits.

Return the **minimum** element in `nums` after all replacements.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [10,12,13,14]

Output: 1

Explanation:

nums becomes [1, 3, 4, 5] after all replacements, with minimum element 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

nums becomes [1, 2, 3, 4] after all replacements, with minimum element 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [999,19,199]

Output: 10

Explanation:

nums becomes [27, 10, 19] after all replacements, with minimum element 10.
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= nums.length <= 100`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
