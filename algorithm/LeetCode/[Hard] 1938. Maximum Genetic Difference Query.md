1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query

There is a rooted tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. Each node's number denotes its **unique genetic value** (i.e. the genetic value of node `x` is `x`). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is defined as the **bitwise-XOR** of their values. You are given the integer array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. If node `x` is the **root** of the tree, then `parents[x] == -1`.

You are also given the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [nodei, vali]`. For each query `i`, find the **maximum genetic difference** between `vali` and `pi`, where `pi` is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between `nodei` and the root (including `nodei` and the root). More formally, you want to maximize `vali XOR pi`.

Return an array ans where `ans[i]` is the answer to the `i`th query.

 

**Example 1:**

![1938_c1.png](img/1938_c1.png)
```
Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
Output: [2,3,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
- [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![1938_c2.png](img/1938_c2.png)
```
Input: parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
Output: [6,14,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
- [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
- [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= parents.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= parents[i] <= parents.length - 1` for every node `i` that is **not** the root.
* `parents[root] == -1`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `0 <= nodei <= parents.length - 1`
* `0 <= vali <= 2 * 10^5`
