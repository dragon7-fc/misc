1220. Count Vowels Permutation

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

* Each character is a lower case vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`)
* Each vowel `'a'` may only be followed by an `'e'`.
* Each vowel `'e'` may only be followed by an `'a'` or an `'i'`.
* Each vowel `'i'` may not be followed by another `'i'`.
* Each vowel `'o'` may only be followed by an `'i'` or a `'u'`.
* Each vowel `'u'` may only be followed by an `'a'`.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: All possible strings are: "a", "e", "i" , "o" and "u".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible strings are: "ae", "ea", "ei", "ia", "ie", "io", "iu", "oi", "ou" and "ua".
```

**Example 3:** 
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 68
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`

# Solution

**Solution 1:**

Each vowel allows some number of subsequent characters. These transitions are like a tree. This problem is asking, "what's the width of the tree with height n?"

My solution keeps track of the number of each vowel at a level in this tree. To calculate say 'A', we calculate how many nodes in the previous level produce 'A'. This is the number of 'E', 'I', and 'U' nodes.

            a, e, i, o, u = e + i + u, a + i, e + o, i, i + o
        return (a + e + i + o + u) % (10**9 + 7)
