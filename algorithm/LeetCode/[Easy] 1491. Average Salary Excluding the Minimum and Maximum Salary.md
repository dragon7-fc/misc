1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary

Given an array of **unique** integers salary where `salary[i]` is the salary of the employee `i`.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000)/2= 2500
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
Output: 2000.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000)/1= 2000
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: salary = [6000,5000,4000,3000,2000,1000]
Output: 3500.00000
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: salary = [8000,9000,2000,3000,6000,1000]
Output: 4750.00000
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
* `10^3 <= salary[i] <= 10^6`
* `salary[i]` is unique.
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
