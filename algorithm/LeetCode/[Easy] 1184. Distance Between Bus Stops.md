1184. Distance Between Bus Stops

A bus has `n` stops numbered from `0` to `n - 1` that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where `distance[i]` is the distance between the stops number `i` and `(i + 1) % n`.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given `start` and `destination` stops.

 

**Example 1:**

![1184_untitled-diagram-1](img/1184_untitled-diagram-1.jpg)

```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![1184_untitled-diagram-1-1](img/1184_untitled-diagram-1-1.jpg)

```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

![1184_untitled-diagram-1-2](img/1184_untitled-diagram-1-2.jpg)

```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `distance.length == n`
* `0 <= start, destination < n`
* `0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4`
