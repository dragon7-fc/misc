1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs

You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `i`th job.

There are `k` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
The maximum working time is 11.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
* `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`

**Solution 1: (Binary Search)**

This code basically reuses the exact code from #698 Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets.

The basic idea is you binary search for a target answer while using the bucket method to see if it's possible.
Since we want to find the lowest/leftmost possible answer, we use lo + hi >> 1, and lo = mid + 1

Optimizations:

1. Place the larger numbers first, as smaller numbers could be placed into a lot of buckets
1. If filling it in this bucket doesnt work, then nothing will work. This is bc we fill previous buckets before trying the next

        def possible(target, buckets, idx):
            if idx == len(jobs):
                return True
            for i in range(len(buckets)):
                buckets[i] += jobs[idx]
                if buckets[i] <= target and possible(target, buckets, idx+1):
                    return True
                buckets[i] -= jobs[idx]
                if buckets[i] == 0: # optimization (2)
                    break
            return False  
        
        lo = max(jobs)
        hi = sum(jobs)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + hi >> 1
            b = [0] * k
            if not possible(mid, b, 0):
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return lo
