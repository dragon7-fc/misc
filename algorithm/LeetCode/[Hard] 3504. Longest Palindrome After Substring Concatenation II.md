3504. Longest Palindrome After Substring Concatenation II

You are given two strings, `s` and `t`.

You can create a new string by selecting a substring from `s` (possibly empty) and a substring from `t` (possibly empty), then concatenating them in order.

Return the length of the **longest palindrome** that can be formed this way.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"

Output: 2

Explanation:

Concatenating "a" from s and "a" from t results in "aa", which is a palindrome of length 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "def"

Output: 1

Explanation:

Since all characters are different, the longest palindrome is any single character, so the answer is 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "b", t = "aaaa"

Output: 4

Explanation:

Selecting "aaaa" from t is the longest palindrome, so the answer is 4.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "abcde", t = "ecdba"

Output: 5

Explanation:

Concatenating "abc" from s and "ba" from t results in "abcba", which is a palindrome of length 5.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (DP Bottom-Up)**

__Intuition__
Reverse t and check for the longest common substring between s and t.

We can do it in n * m time using dp.

Note that a cubic (brute-force) solution is accepted in some languages. It is not supposed to, and LeetCode might tighten the limits at some point.

__Approach__
After finding a common substring in s and t, we also need to check for a palindrome in the remaining suffix.

Example:

s: 'abcxxyxxz'
t: 'ddcbad', or reversed, 'dabcdd'.
The longest common substring is 'abc', however there is a palindrome 'xxyxx' in s right after 'abc' (so, the result is 'abc xxyxx cba').

We populate s_pal[i] and t_pal[i] with the longest palindrome size that starts at i. We can brute-force it in n ^ 2 time.

The Manacher's algo cuts the time to O(n), though it does not impact the overall complexity.
Check out the "C++ Manacher's" code if interested.

__Complexity__
Time: O(n ^ 2), where n is the size of the longest string.
O(n * m) for the Manacher's variant.
Memory: O(n * m).
