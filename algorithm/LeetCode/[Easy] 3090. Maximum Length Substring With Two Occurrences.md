3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences

Given a string `s`, return the maximum length of a **substring**  such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "bcbbbcba"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
