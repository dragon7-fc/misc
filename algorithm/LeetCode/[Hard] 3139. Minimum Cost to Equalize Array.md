3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `cost1` and `cost2`. You are allowed to perform either of the following operations any number of times:

* Choose an index `i` from `nums` and **increase** `nums[i]` by `1` for a cost of `cost1`.
* Choose two different indices `i`, `j`, from `nums` and **increase** `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` by `1` for a cost of `cost2`.

Return the **minimum** cost required to make all elements in the array equal.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,1], cost1 = 5, cost2 = 2

Output: 15

Explanation:

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,2].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,3].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,4].
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,3,5], cost1 = 2, cost2 = 1

Output: 6

Explanation:

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] and nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [3,4,3,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,4,4,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,4,4,4,5].
Increase nums[1] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5,4,5].
Increase nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 2. nums becomes [5,5,5,5,5].
The total cost is 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,5,3], cost1 = 1, cost2 = 3

Output: 4

Explanation:

The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,5,3].
Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,3].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,4].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5].
The total cost is 4.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
* `1 <= cost1 <= 106`
* `1 <= cost2 <= 106`

**Solution 1: (4 cases, O(n) solution)**

__Explanation__
Calculate the min(A) and max(A)
total = max(A) * n - sum(A), total is the minimum increments need to do.

* Case 1:
c1 * 2 < c2
operation 1 is always better operation 2,
we simply return total * c1 % mod

* Case 2:
c1 * 2 > c2
We do operation 2 as many as possible,
and use operation 1 to complete.

* Case 3:
c1 * 2 >> c2
Previously we increment to max(A),
now we can increment to max(A) + x
So that can do few operation 1 and mostly operation 2.

* Case 4:
c1 * 2 >>>>> c2
We won't do any operation 1.


__Complexity__
Time O(n)
Space O(1)
