3774. Absolute Difference Between Maximum and Minimum K Elements

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the absolute difference between:

* the sum of the `k` largest elements in the array; and
* the sum of the `k` smallest elements in the array.

Return an integer denoting this difference.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,2,2,4], k = 2

Output: 5

Explanation:

The k = 2 largest elements are 4 and 5. Their sum is 4 + 5 = 9.
The k = 2 smallest elements are 2 and 2. Their sum is 2 + 2 = 4.
The absolute difference is abs(9 - 4) = 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [100], k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

The largest element is 100.
The smallest element is 100.
The absolute difference is abs(100 - 100) = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= n`

        for (i = 0; i < k; i ++) {
            ans += nums[n + i - k] - nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
