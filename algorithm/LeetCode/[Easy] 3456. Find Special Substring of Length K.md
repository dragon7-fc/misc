3456. Find Special Substring of Length K

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Determine if there exists a **substring** of length exactly `k` in `s` that satisfies the following conditions:

* The substring consists of **only one distinct character** (e.g., `"aaa"` or `"bbb"`).
* If there is a character **immediately before** the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
* If there is a character **immediately after** the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return `true` if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aaabaaa", k = 3

Output: true

Explanation:

The substring s[4..6] == "aaa" satisfies the conditions.

It has a length of 3.
All characters are the same.
The character before "aaa" is 'b', which is different from 'a'.
There is no character after "aaa".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abc", k = 2

Output: false

Explanation:

There is no substring of length 2 that consists of one distinct character and satisfies the conditions.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
