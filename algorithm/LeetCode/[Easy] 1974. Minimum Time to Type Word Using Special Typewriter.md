1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter

There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a **circle** with a **pointer**. A character can only be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is **initially** pointing to the character `'a'`.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

* Move the pointer one character **counterclockwise** or **clockwise**.
* Type the character the pointer is **currently** on.

Given a string `word`, return the **minimum** number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "bza"
Output: 7
Explanation:
The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word = "zjpc"
Output: 34
Explanation:
The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
