3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits

You are given a positive number `n`.

Return the **smallest** number `x` **greater than or equal to** `n`, such that the binary representation of `x` contains only **set** bits.

A **set** bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of `1`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5

Output: 7

Explanation:

The binary representation of 7 is "111".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10

Output: 15

Explanation:

The binary representation of 15 is "1111".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

The binary representation of 3 is "11".
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`
