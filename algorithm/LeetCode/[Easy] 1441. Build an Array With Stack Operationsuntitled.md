1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

Given an array `target` and an integer `n`. In each iteration, you will read a number from  `list = {1,2,3..., n}`.

Build the `target` array using the following operations:

* **Push:** Read a new element from the beginning list, and push it in the array.
* **Pop:** delete the last element of the array.
* If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

You are guaranteed that the `target` array is strictly increasing, only containing numbers between `1` to `n` inclusive.

Return the operations to build the `target` array.

You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: 
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: target = [2,3,4], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= target.length <= 100`
* `1 <= target[i] <= 100`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `target` is strictly increasing.
