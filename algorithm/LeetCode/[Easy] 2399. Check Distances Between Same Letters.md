2399. Check Distances Between Same Letters

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in s appears **exactly twice**. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `distance` of length `26`.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from `0` to `25` (i.e. `'a'` -> `0`, `'b'` -> `1`, `'c'` -> `2`, ... , `'z'` -> `25`).

In a **well-spaced** string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the `i`th letter is `distance[i]`. If the `i`th letter does not appear in `s`, then `distance[i]` can be **ignored**.

Return `true` if `s` is a **well-spaced** string, otherwise return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abaccb", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aa", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 52`
* `s consists only of lowercase English letters`.
* `Each letter appears in s exactly twice`.
* `distance.length == 26`
* `0 <= distance[i] <= 50`
