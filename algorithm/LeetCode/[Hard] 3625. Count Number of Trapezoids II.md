3625. Count Number of Trapezoids II

You are given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the `i`th point on the Cartesian plane.

Return the number of unique trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from `points`.

A **trapezoid** is a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair** of parallel sides. Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[-3,2],[3,0],[2,3],[3,2],[2,-3]]

Output: 2

![3625_desmos-graph-3.png](img/3625_desmos-graph-3.png)
```
There are two distinct ways to pick four points that form a trapezoid:

The points [-3,2], [2,3], [3,2], [2,-3] form one trapezoid.
The points [2,3], [3,2], [3,0], [2,-3] form another trapezoid.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[2,1]]

Output: 1

Explanation:
```

```
There is only one trapezoid which can be formed.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `4 <= points.length <= 500`
* `â€“1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000`
* All points are pairwise distinct.
