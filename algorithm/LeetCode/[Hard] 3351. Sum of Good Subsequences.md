3351. Sum of Good Subsequences

You are given an integer array `nums`. A **good subsequence** is defined as a subsequence of `nums` where the absolute difference between any **two** consecutive elements in the subsequence is exactly `1`.

Return the **sum** of all possible **good subsequences** of `nums`.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note** that a subsequence of size 1 is considered good by definition.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: 14

Explanation:

Good subsequences are: [1], [2], [1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2,1].
The sum of elements in these subsequences is 14.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5]

Output: 40

Explanation:

Good subsequences are: [3], [4], [5], [3,4], [4,5], [3,4,5].
The sum of elements in these subsequences is 40.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
