496. Next Greater Element I

You are given two arrays (**without duplicates**) `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1`â€™s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.

The Next Greater Number of a number **x** in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

**Note:**

* All elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
* The length of both `nums1` and `nums2` would not exceed `1000`.
