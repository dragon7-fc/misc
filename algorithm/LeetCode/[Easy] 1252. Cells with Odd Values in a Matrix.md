1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

Given `n` and `m` which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros and given an array indices where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]`. For each pair of `[ri, ci]` you have to increment all cells in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.

Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying the increment to all `indices`.

 

**Example 1:**

![1252_e1](img/1252_e1.png)

```
Input: n = 2, m = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix will be [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]] which contains 6 odd numbers.
```

**Example 2:**

![1252_e2](img/1252_e2.png)

```
Input: n = 2, m = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There is no odd number in the final matrix.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 50`
* `1 <= m <= 50`
* `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
* `0 <= indices[i][0] < n`
* `0 <= indices[i][1] < m`
