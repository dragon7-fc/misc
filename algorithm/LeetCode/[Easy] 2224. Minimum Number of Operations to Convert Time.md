2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two **24-hour times**.

24-hour times are formatted as `"HH:MM"`, where `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and `MM` is between `00` and `59`. The earliest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the latest is `23:59`.

In one operation you can increase the time current by `1`, `5`, `15`, or `60` minutes. You can perform this operation **any** number of times.

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to convert `current` to `correct`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "03:30".
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes "04:30".
- Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes "04:35".
It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: current = "11:00", correct = "11:01"
Output: 1
Explanation: We only have to add one minute to current, so the minimum number of operations needed is 1.
```

Constraints:

* `current` and `correct` are in the format `"HH:MM"`
* `current <= correct`

        for i in [60, 15, 5, 1]:
            count += diff // i # add number of operations needed with i to count
            diff %= i # Diff becomes modulo of diff with i
