2488. Count Subarrays With Median K

You are given an array `nums` of size `n` consisting of distinct integers from `1` to `n` and a positive integer `k`.

Return the number of non-empty subarrays in `nums` that have a **median** equal to `k`.

Note:

* The median of an array is the **middle** element after sorting the array in **ascending** order. If the array is of even length, the median is the **left** middle element.
    * For example, the median of `[2,3,1,4]` is `2`, and the median of `[8,4,3,5,1]` is `4`.
* A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,4,5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarrays that have a median equal to 4 are: [4], [4,5] and [1,4,5].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: [3] is the only subarray that has a median equal to 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i], k <= n`
* The integers in nums are distinct.

**Solution 1: (Hash Table)**

**Intuition**

* We are looking for subarrays that contain k.
* Elements are unique (from 1 to n).
* Since the subarray has to contain k, and there is only one k, we can start from k to build the subarrays.

What makes a valid subarray (i.e., k as the median)?

* the number of elements larger than k == the number of elements smaller than k (odd length)
* the number of elements larger than k + 1 == the number of elements smaller than k (even length)
=> large == small or large+1 == small

**Algorithm**

We can check the elements before k and after k, and count the number of elements larger/smaller than k.

* let's use l1 and s1 denoting the number of elements larger and smaller than k, Before k.
* and l2, s2 denoting the number of elements larger and smaller than k, After k.
=> The above equation becomes:
* l1 + l2 == s1 + s2 => l1 - s1 == s2 - l2
* l1 + l2 + 1 == s1 + s2 => l1 - s1 == s2 - l2 + 1

Now we can use a hash map to count the frequency of l1 - s1 for the subarray before k (and contains k).
Then, check if s2 - l2 and s2 - l2 + 1 in the hash map for the subarray after k (and contains k) to compute the result.

TC O(n), since we only go through the elements before k and after k once.

            # we need the number of larger elements and smaller elements to be the same in a subarray,
            #    l1 + l2 == s1 + s2 or l1 + l2 + 1 == s1 + s2
            # => l1 - s1 == s2 - l2 or l1 - s1 == s2 - l2 + 1
            # so we need to check if s2-l2 or s2-l2+1 exist in before
            res += before[s2-l2] + before[s2-l2+1]
