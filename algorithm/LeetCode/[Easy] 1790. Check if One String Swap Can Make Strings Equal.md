1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
* `s1.length == s2.length`
* `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

                S2.append(l2)
            if len(S1) > 2: #more than 2 disagreement
                return False
        return S1 == S2[::-1] #whether swap is position
