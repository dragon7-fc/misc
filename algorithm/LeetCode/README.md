# Must do questions for a beginner!!

Start with the questions which are tagged easy. Keep a goal of solving 5 questions daily, if you are not able to solve 5 in a day, reduce it to 2-3 questions. In the same way, you can increase the count to 8-10 questions daily. Make sure you remember your approach and try to explore more approaches available for that question.

A must do list according to me:
(these are some of the easy questions - once your solution gets accepted, leetcode shows you suggestion for next similar questions, you can solve them too rather than following this list.)

#20 Valid Paranthesis
#21 Merge two sorted lists
#236 LCA of a binary tree
#189 Rotate array

```
(list of medium questions - once you get comfortable with the platform and the questions, you can jump to these questions.)
