817. Linked List Components

We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```

Note:

* If N is the length of the linked list given by head, 1 <= N <= 10000.
* The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [0, N - 1].
* 1 <= G.length <= 10000.
* G is a subset of all values in the linked list.
