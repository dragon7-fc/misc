1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros


Given a binary string `s`, return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of `1`s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of `0`s in s. Return `false` otherwise.

For example, in `s = "110100010"` the longest contiguous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`s, then the longest contiguous segment of `0`s is considered to have length `0`. The same applies if there are no `1`s.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: true
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "110100010"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
