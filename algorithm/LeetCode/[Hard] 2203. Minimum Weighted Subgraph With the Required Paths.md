2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from `fromi` to `toi` with weight `weighti`.

Lastly, you are given three distinct integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach `dest` from both `src1` and `src2` via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

 

**Example 1:**

![2203_example1drawio.png](img/2203_example1drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
Output: 9
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
```

**Example 2:**

![2203_example2-1drawio.png](img/2203_example2-1drawio.png)
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`
* `fromi != toi`
* `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.
* `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5`

**Solution 1: (3 Dijkstras)**

The idea is the following: paths from s1 to dest and from s2 to destcan have common pointx`. Then we need to reach:

1. From s1 to x, for this we use Dijkstra
1. From s2 to x, same.
1. From x to dest, for this we use Dijkstra on the reversed graph.
1. Finally, we check all possible x.

**Remark**

In python it was quite challenging to get AC, and I need to look for faster implementation of Dijkstra, however complexity is still the same, it depends on implementation details.

**Complexity**

It is O(n*log E) for time and O(n) for space.

        G1 = defaultdict(list)
        G2 = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b, w in edges:
            G1[a].append((b, w))
            G2[b].append((a, w))

        def Dijkstra(graph, K):
            q, t = [(0, K)], {}
            while q:
                time, node = heappop(q)
                if node not in t:
                    t[node] = time
                    for v, w in graph[node]:
                        heappush(q, (time + w, v))
            return [t.get(i, float("inf")) for i in range(n)]
        
        arr1 = Dijkstra(G1, src1)
        arr2 = Dijkstra(G1, src2)
        arr3 = Dijkstra(G2, dest)
        
        ans = float("inf")
        for i in range(n):
            ans = min(ans, arr1[i] + arr2[i] + arr3[i])
        
        return ans if ans != float("inf") else -1
```

**Solution 2: (3 Dijkstras)**

**Intuition:** At some point, paths from both sources will reach some common node.

Say, this common node is i. The weight of the graph will be the sum of:

* Minimum distance from first source to i.
* Minimum distance from second source to i.
* Minimum distance from i to the destination.

We run Dijkstra 3 times from both sources and destination. Note that to find smallest distance from all nodes to the destination, we run Dijkstra in reverse from the destination.
