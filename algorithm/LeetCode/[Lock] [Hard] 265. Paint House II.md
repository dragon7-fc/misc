265. Paint House II

There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a `n x k` cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Note:**

All costs are positive integers.

**Example:**
```
Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5. 
```
