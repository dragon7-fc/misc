2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers

You have n computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array `batteries` where the `i`th battery can **run** a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running all n computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously.

 

**Example 1:**

![2141_example1-fit.png](img/2141_example1-fit.png)
```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![2141_example2.png](img/2141_example2.png)
```
Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Sort)**

__Intuition__
The staright idea, is to use all baterial evenly.
So we take advantage of all the energy wihout any left.
In this case, we can run up to sum(A) / n minutes.
This average value is an upper bounde of the final result.
It's great to start with this enviromental intuition.

__Explanation__
However, there may be some betteries that has too much energy.
They are in charge all the time,
but still can't run out all they have,
then their energy wastes.

So we can compare the average value with the most powerful battery max(A).
If max(A) is bigger, then we can use this battery to charge a computer all the time.
Now we reduce the problem to the left bettery and n - 1 computers.

We continue doing this process,
until the most powerful bettery max(A) can not run average time sum(A) / n.
Then the left betteries can help each other and be use evenly until the end.
One key point of this problem, it's to find out, why betteries can be used "evenly" in this situation.

One quick "prove" is that, the max(A) is smaller than the running time,
so the maximum battery won't get wasted,
the other smaller betteries won't even get easted.


__Complexity__
Time O(sort)
Space O(sort)

The best solution can be O(A), similar to quick select algo.
