3574. Maximize Subarray GCD Score

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`.

You may perform at most `k` operations. In each operation, you can choose one element in the array and **double** its value. Each element can be doubled **at most once**.

The **score** of a contiguous **subarray** is defined as the **product** of its length and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all its elements.

Your task is to return the **maximum score** that can be achieved by selecting a contiguous subarray from the modified array.

**Note**:

* The **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,4], k = 1

Output: 8

Explanation:

Double nums[0] to 4 using one operation. The modified array becomes [4, 4].
The GCD of the subarray [4, 4] is 4, and the length is 2.
Thus, the maximum possible score is 2 × 4 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,5,7], k = 2

Output: 14

Explanation:

Double nums[2] to 14 using one operation. The modified array becomes [3, 5, 14].
The GCD of the subarray [14] is 14, and the length is 1.
Thus, the maximum possible score is 1 × 14 = 14.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 1

Output: 15

Explanation:

The subarray [5, 5, 5] has a GCD of 5, and its length is 3.
Since doubling any element doesn't improve the score, the maximum score is 3 × 5 = 15.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 1500`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= n`

**Solution 1: (Pow of 2)**

__Intuition__
Doubling an element increases its value and can improve the GCD of a subarray.

We will double A[i] with the minimum pow of 2.

🛠️ Explanation
For each number A[i], extract its power-of-two part B[i] = A[i] & -A[i].

Brute Force All Subarrays:

For each subarray [i, j], compute:

GCD of the A[i..j]

Minimum power-of-two min_pow = min(B[i..j])

Count how many times min_pow appears in the subarray

If count ≤ k, you can double all of them, so multiply GCD by 2.

Compute score = GCD × (2 if count ≤ k) × length

Update res with the maximum score found.

__Key Insight:__
Doubling an element is equivalent to doubling its B[i] value, which influences the GCD.
So you're tracking how many elements in the subarray share the smallest B[i], and only try doubling those.

Time: O(n² log max(A)).
