338. Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number `num`. For every numbers i in the range **0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num** calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time **O(n*sizeof(integer))**. But can you do it in linear time **O(n)** /possibly in a single pass?
* Space complexity should be **O(n)**.
* Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like **__builtin_popcount** in c++ or in any other language.
