3445. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the **maximum** difference between the frequency of two characters, `freq[a] - freq[b]`, in a **substring** `subs` of `s`, such that:

* *subs* has a size of at least `k`.
* Character `a` has an odd frequency in `subs`.
* Character `b` has an even frequency in `subs`.

Return the **maximum** difference.

**Note** that `subs` can contain more than 2 **distinct** characters.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "12233", k = 4

Output: -1

Explanation:

For the substring "12233", the frequency of '1' is 1 and the frequency of '3' is 2. The difference is 1 - 2 = -1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "1122211", k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

For the substring "11222", the frequency of '2' is 3 and the frequency of '1' is 2. The difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "110", k = 3

Output: -1
```
 

**Constraints:**

`3 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`
`s` consists only of digits `'0'` to `'4'`.
The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
`1 <= k <= s.length`
