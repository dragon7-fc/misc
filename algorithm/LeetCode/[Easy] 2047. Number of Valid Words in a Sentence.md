2047. Number of Valid Words in a Sentence

A sentence consists of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), digits (`'0'` to `'9'`), hyphens (`'-'`), punctuation marks (`'!'`, `'.'`, and `','`), and spaces (`' '`) only. Each sentence can be broken down into **one or more tokens** separated by one or more spaces `' '`.

A token is a valid word if:

* It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation (no digits).
* There is **at most one** hyphen `'-'`. If present, it should be surrounded by lowercase characters (`"a-b"` is valid, but `"-ab"` and `"ab-"` are not valid).
* There is **at most one** punctuation mark. If present, it should be at the end of the token.

Examples of valid words include `"a-b."`, `"afad"`, `"ba-c"`, `"a!"`, and `"!"`.

Given a string `sentence`, return the number of valid words in sentence.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: sentence = "cat and  dog"
Output: 3
Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "cat", "and", and "dog".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: sentence = "!this  1-s b8d!"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no valid words in the sentence.
"!this" is invalid because it starts with a punctuation mark.
"1-s" and "b8d" are invalid because they contain digits.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: sentence = "alice and  bob are playing stone-game10"
Output: 5
Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "alice", "and", "bob", "are", and "playing".
"stone-game10" is invalid because it contains digits.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: sentence = "he bought 2 pencils, 3 erasers, and 1  pencil-sharpener."
Output: 6
Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "he", "bought", "pencils,", "erasers,", "and", and "pencil-sharpener.".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sentence.length <= 1000`
* `sentence` only contains lowercase English letters, digits, `' '`, `'-'`, `'!'`, `'.'`, and `','`.
* There will be at least `1` token.
