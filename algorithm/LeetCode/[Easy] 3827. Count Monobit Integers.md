3827. Count Monobit Integers

You are given an integer `n`.

An integer is called **Monobit** if all bits in its binary representation are the same.

Return the count of **Monobit** integers in the range `[0, n]` (inclusive).

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 1] have binary representations "0" and "1".
Each representation consists of identical bits. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integers in the range [0, 4] include binaries "0", "1", "10", "11", and "100".
Only 0, 1 and 3 satisfy the Monobit condition. Thus, the answer is 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 1000`

**Solution 1: (Math)**

all numbers must be in the form 2^k - 1
k = 0 -> n = 0 : bit-> "0"
k = 1 -> n = 1 : bit-> "1"
k = 2 -> n = 3 : bit-> "11"
so on..

2^k - 1 = n

k = log2(n+1)

k+1 is adjustment for the counting of 0
since in our form k is 0 indexed
but while counting it should be 1 indexed
take the power as k-1 if you want better clarity
