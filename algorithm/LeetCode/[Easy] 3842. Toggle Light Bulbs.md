3842. Toggle Light Bulbs

You are given an array `bulbs` of integers between 1 and 100.

There are 100 light bulbs numbered from 1 to 100. All of them are switched off initially.

For each element `bulbs[i]` in the array `bulbs`:

* If the `bulbs[i]`th light bulb is currently off, switch it on.
* Otherwise, switch it off.

Return the list of integers denoting the light bulbs that are on in the end, sorted in **ascending** order. If no bulb is on, return an empty list.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: bulbs = [10,30,20,10]

Output: [20,30]

Explanation:

The bulbs[0] = 10th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[1] = 30th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[2] = 20th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[3] = 10th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
In the end, the 20th and the 30th light bulbs are on.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: bulbs = [100,100]

Output: []

Explanation:

The bulbs[0] = 100th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
The bulbs[1] = 100th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
In the end, no light bulb is on.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= bulbs.length <= 100`
* `1 <= bulbs[i] <= 100`
