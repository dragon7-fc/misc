1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points

On a plane there are `n` points with integer coordinates `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.

You can move according to the next rules:

* In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).

* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
 

**Example 1:**

![1266_1626_example_1](img/1266_1626_example_1.png)

```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

* `points.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000`
