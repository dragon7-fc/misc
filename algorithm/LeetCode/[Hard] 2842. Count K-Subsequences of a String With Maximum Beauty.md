2842. Count K-Subsequences of a String With Maximum Beauty

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

A **k-subsequence** is a subsequence of `s`, having length `k`, and all `i`ts characters are **unique**, i.e., every character occurs once.

Let `f(c)` denote the number of times the character `c` occurs in `s`.

The **beauty** of a **k-subsequence** is the sum of `f(c)` for every character `c` in the k-subsequence.

For example, consider `s = "abbbdd"` and `k = 2`:

* `f('a') = 1, f('b') = 3, f('d') = 2`
* Some k-subsequences of `s` are:
* `"abbbdd" -> "ab"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('b') = 4`
* `"abbbdd" -> "ad"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('d') = 3`
* `"abbbdd" -> "bd"` having a beauty of `f('b') + f('d') = 5`

Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose i**beauty** is the **maximum** among all **k-subsequences**. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

**Notes**

* `f(c)` is the number of times a character `c` occurs in `s`, not a k-subsequence.
* Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "bcca", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are: 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2 
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3 
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3. 
Hence, the answer is 4. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abbcd", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 2, f('c') = 1, and f('d') = 1. 
The k-subsequences of s are: 
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5 
There are 2 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 5. 
Hence, the answer is 2. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= s.length`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

**Solution 1: (Math)**

__Intuition__
We will pick k characters with the biggest frequency.
There is a bar to be selected.
If freq > bar, will be selected.
If freq < bar, won't be selected.
If freq == bar, will become a pending candidates.


__Explanation__
We firstly count the frequency of all chatacters.
Sort the frequency, and find out the kth biggest frequency, which is the bar.

Then we iterate all frequencies,
If freq > bar, will be selected, res = res * freq % mod
If freq == bar,
will become a pending candidates, and we only need some of them.

Finally we return product(k biggest frequencies) * combination(pending, need),

                res = res * v % mod
            if v == bar:
                m += 1
        return res * comb(m, k) * pow(bar, k, mod) % mod
