2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you may do the following:

* Choose **two** integers in `nums` that are **equal**.
* Remove both integers from `nums`, forming a **pair**.

The operation is done on `nums` as many times as possible.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `answer` of size `2` where `answer[0]` is the number of pairs that are formed and `answer[1]` is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 1 pair has been formed, and there are 0 numbers leftover in nums.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: No pairs can be formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
