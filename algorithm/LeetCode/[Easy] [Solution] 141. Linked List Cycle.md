141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (`0`-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false

## Approach 1: Hash Table
**Intuition**

To detect if a list is cyclic, we can check whether a node had been visited before. A natural way is to use a hash table.

**Algorithm**

We go through each node one by one and record each node's reference (or memory address) in a hash table. If the current node is null, we have reached the end of the list and it must not be cyclic. If current nodeâ€™s reference is in the hash table, then return `true`.

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    Set<ListNode> nodesSeen = new HashSet<>();
    while (head != null) {
        if (nodesSeen.contains(head)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            nodesSeen.add(head);
        }
        head = head.next;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $O(n)$. We visit each of the $n$ elements in the list at most once. Adding a node to the hash table costs only $O(1)$ time.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$. The space depends $n$ the number of elements added to the hash table, which contains at most $n$ elements.

## Approach 2: Two Pointers
**Intuition**

Imagine two runners running on a track at different speed. What happens when the track is actually a circle?

**Algorithm**

The space complexity can be reduced to $O(1)$ by considering two pointers at different speed - a `slow` pointer and a `fast` pointer. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.

If there is no cycle in the list, the `fast` pointer will eventually reach the end and we can return `false` in this case.

Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the `slow` and `fast` pointers are two runners racing around a circle track. The `fast` runner will eventually meet the `slow` runner. Why? Consider this case (we name it case A) - The `fast` runner is just one step behind the `slow` runner. In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.

How about other cases? For example, we have not considered cases where the `fast` runner is two or three steps behind the `slow` runner yet. This is simple, because in the next or next's next iteration, this case will be reduced to case A mentioned above.

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return false;
    }
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head.next;
    while (slow != fast) {
        if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $O(n)$. Let us denote nn as the total number of nodes in the linked list. To analyze its time complexity, we consider the following two cases separately.

    * List has no cycle:
    
    The `fast` pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is $O(n)$.
    * List has a cycle:
    
    We break down the movement of the `slow` pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:

        * The `slow` pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. $\text{Number of iterations} = \text{non-cyclic length} = N$

        * Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the `fast` runner moves 2 steps while the `slow` runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes $\dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}}$ loops for the `fast` runner to catch up with the `slow` runner. As the distance is at most "$\text{cyclic length K}$" and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
$\text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}$ "$\text{cyclic length K}$".

Therefore, the worst case time complexity is $O(N+K)$, which is $O(n)$.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$. We only use two nodes (`slow` and `fast`) so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
