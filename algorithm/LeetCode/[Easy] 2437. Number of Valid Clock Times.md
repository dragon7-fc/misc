2437. Number of Valid Clock Times

You are given a string of length `5` called `time`, representing the current time on a digital clock in the format `"hh:mm"`. The **earliest** possible time is `"00:00"` and the **latest** possible time is `"23:59"`.

In the string `time`, the digits represented by the `?` symbol are **unknown**, and must be **replaced** with a digit from `0` to `9`.

Return an integer `answer`, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every `?` with a digit from `0` to `9`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: time = "?5:00"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the ? with either a 0 or 1, producing "05:00" or "15:00". Note that we cannot replace it with a 2, since the time "25:00" is invalid. In total, we have two choices.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: time = "0?:0?"
Output: 100
Explanation: Each ? can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9, so we have 100 total choices.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: time = "??:??"
Output: 1440
Explanation: There are 24 possible choices for the hours, and 60 possible choices for the minutes. In total, we have 24 * 60 = 1440 choices.
```

**Constraints:**

* `time` is a valid string of length `5` in the format `"hh:mm"`.
* `"00" <= hh <= "23"`
* `"00" <= mm <= "59"`
* Some of the digits might be replaced with `'?'` and need to be replaced with digits from `0` to `9`.
