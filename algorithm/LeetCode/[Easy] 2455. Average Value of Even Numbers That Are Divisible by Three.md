2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three

Given an integer array `nums` of **positive** integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by `3`.

Note that the **average** of `n` elements is the **sum** of the `n` elements divided by `n` and rounded down to the nearest integer.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]
Output: 9
Explanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,7,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

    def averageValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        cur = [num for num in nums if num%6 == 0]
        return sum(cur)//len(cur) if cur else 0
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int averageValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0, count = 0;
        for(auto n: nums){
            if(n%3 == 0 && n%2 == 0){
                sum += n;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count != 0 ? sum/count: 0;
    }
};
