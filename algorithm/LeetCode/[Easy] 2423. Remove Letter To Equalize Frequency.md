2423. Remove Letter To Equalize Frequency

You are given a **0-indexed** string `word`, consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to select **one** index and **remove** the letter at that index from `word` so that the **frequency** of every letter present in word is equal.

Return `true` if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency of all letters in `word` are equal, and `false` otherwise.

**Note:**

* The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.
* You **must** remove exactly one letter and cannot chose to do nothing.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "abcc"
Output: true
Explanation: Select index 3 and delete it: word becomes "abc" and each character has a frequency of 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "aazz"
Output: false
Explanation: We must delete a character, so either the frequency of "a" is 1 and the frequency of "z" is 2, or vice versa. It is impossible to make all present letters have equal frequency.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= word.length <= 100`
* `word` consists of lowercase English letters only.
