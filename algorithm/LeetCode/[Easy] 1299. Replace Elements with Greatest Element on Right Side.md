1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side

Given an array `arr`, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with `-1`.

After doing so, return the array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

**Solution 1: (Array)**

**Explanation**

* Iterate from the back to the start,
* We initilize `mx = -1`, where `mx` represent the max on the right.
* Each round, we set `A[i] = mx`, where `mx` is its mas on the right.
* Also we update `mx = max(mx, A[i])`, where `A[i]` is its original value.


**Complexity**

* Time O(N)
* Space O(1)
