3486. Longest Special Path II

You are given an undirected tree rooted at node `0`, with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, lengthi]` indicates an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with length `lengthi`. You are also given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the value at node `i`.

A **special path** is defined as a **downward** path from an ancestor node to a descendant node in which all node values are distinct, except for at most one value that may appear twice.

Return an array `result` of size `2`, where `result[0]` is the **length** of the **longest** special path, and `result[1]` is the **minimum** number of nodes in all possible **longest** special paths.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,3],[1,3,1],[2,4,6],[4,7,2],[3,5,2],[3,6,5],[6,8,3]], nums = [1,1,0,3,1,2,1,1,0]

Output: [9,3]

Explanation:

In the image below, nodes are colored by their corresponding values in nums.
```

```
The longest special paths are 1 -> 2 -> 4 and 1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 8, both having a length of 9. The minimum number of nodes across all longest special paths is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: edges = [[1,0,3],[0,2,4],[0,3,5]], nums = [1,1,0,2]

Output: [5,2]

Explanation:
```
![3486_e2.png](img/3486_e2.png)
```
The longest path is 0 -> 3 consisting of 2 nodes with a length of 5.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= ui, vi < n`
* `1 <= lengthi <= 10^3`
* `nums.length == n`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`
* The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
