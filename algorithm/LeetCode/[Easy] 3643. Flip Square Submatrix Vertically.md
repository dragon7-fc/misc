3643. Flip Square Submatrix Vertically

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `x`, `y`, and `k`.

The integers `x` and `y` represent the row and column indices of the top-left corner of a square submatrix and the integer `k` represents the size (side length) of the square submatrix.

Your task is to flip the submatrix by reversing the order of its rows vertically.

Return the updated matrix.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], x = 1, y = 0, k = 3

Output: [[1,2,3,4],[13,14,15,8],[9,10,11,12],[5,6,7,16]]

Explanation:

The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[3,4,2,3],[2,3,4,2]], x = 0, y = 2, k = 2

Output: [[3,4,4,2],[2,3,2,3]]

Explanation:

The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 50`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
* `0 <= x < m`
* `0 <= y < n`
* `1 <= k <= min(m - x, n - y)`
