3485. Longest Common Prefix of K Strings After Removal

You are given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`.

For each index `i` in the range `[0, words.length - 1]`, find the length of the longest common prefix among any `k` strings (selected at distinct indices) from the remaining array after removing the ith element.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the answer for `i`th element. If removing the ith element leaves the array with fewer than `k` strings, `answer[i]` is `0`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["jump","run","run","jump","run"], k = 2

Output: [3,4,4,3,4]

Explanation:

Removing index 0 ("jump"):
words becomes: ["run", "run", "jump", "run"]. "run" occurs 3 times. Choosing any two gives the longest common prefix "run" (length 3).
Removing index 1 ("run"):
words becomes: ["jump", "run", "jump", "run"]. "jump" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix "jump" (length 4).
Removing index 2 ("run"):
words becomes: ["jump", "run", "jump", "run"]. "jump" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix "jump" (length 4).
Removing index 3 ("jump"):
words becomes: ["jump", "run", "run", "run"]. "run" occurs 3 times. Choosing any two gives the longest common prefix "run" (length 3).
Removing index 4 ("run"):
words becomes: ["jump", "run", "run", "jump"]. "jump" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix "jump" (length 4).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["dog","racer","car"], k = 2

Output: [0,0,0]

Explanation:

Removing any index results in an answer of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= words.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10^4`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* The sum of `words[i].length` is smaller than or equal `10^5`.
