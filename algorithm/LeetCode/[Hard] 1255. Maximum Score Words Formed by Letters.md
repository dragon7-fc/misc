1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters

Given a list of `words`, list of  single `letters` (might be repeating) and `score` of every character.

Return the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters (`words[i]` cannot be used two or more times).

It is not necessary to use all characters in `letters` and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters `'a', 'b', 'c', ... ,'z'` is given by `score[0], score[1], ... , score[25]` respectively.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"], letters = ["a","a","c","d","d","d","g","o","o"], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 23
Explanation:
Score  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2
Given letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.
Words "dad" and "dog" only get a score of 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["xxxz","ax","bx","cx"], letters = ["z","a","b","c","x","x","x"], score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Score  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10
Given letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5) and "cx" (4+5) with a score of 27.
Word "xxxz" only get a score of 25.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["leetcode"], letters = ["l","e","t","c","o","d"], score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Letter "e" can only be used once.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 14`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 15`
* `1 <= letters.length <= 100`
* `letters[i].length == 1`
* `score.length == 26`
* `0 <= score[i] <= 10`
* `words[i]`, letters[i] contains only lower case English letters.

**Solution 1: (Backtracking, Bit Manipulation)**

This problem is about finding a combination that the combination of the words whose total letter consumptions are restricted by letters (covert to a character counter) that achieved the highest score.
So we can use DFS here to search all valid combinations and find out the highest score. To reduce the search space, we can prune the branch and backtrack when current branch is no longer valid or can't reach the current highest score.

Each time, we search from index `i` and all the rest node `words[i:]` are potential candidates to DFS.
Suppose in one of DFS branch, we pass `words[i:j]` and check the node `words[j]`. If `words[j]`'s letter consumption doesn't exceed the current letters restriction, we are good to add its score and keep DFS from `j+1`.
We can check this by `if all(n <= letters.get(c,0)` for `c`,`n` in `Counter(words[j]).items())`
And when we DFS from `words[j]`, we also need to reduce letters resource by `words[j]`'s letter consumption. Or we can pass a new counter argument to DFS as `new_letter = {c:n-Counter(words[j]).get(c,0)`` for `c`,`n` in `letter.items()`}

To improve performance, we can precomputer each word's letter counter and its score:

```
words_score = [sum(score[ord(c)-ord('a')] for c in word) for word in words]
words_counter = [collections.Counter(word) for word in words]
```

And we can also prune the branch once `curr_score + sum(words_score[i:]) <= self.max_score` as there is no possibility for current branch exceeding the maximum score so far. We are also precompute a suffix sum array to avoid calculating `sum(words_score[i:]` each time. But I save it here as the `words.length <= 15`.
