3746. Minimum String Length After Balanced Removals

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'` and `'b'`.

You are allowed to repeatedly remove any substring where the number of `'a'` characters is equal to the number of `'b'` characters. After each removal, the remaining parts of the string are concatenated together without gaps.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** possible length of the string after performing any number of such operations.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aabbab"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The substring "aabbab" has three 'a' and three 'b'. Since their counts are equal, we can remove the entire string directly. The minimum length is 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaaa"

Output: 4

Explanation:

Every substring of "aaaa" contains only 'a' characters. No substring can be removed as a result, so the minimum length remains 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aaabb"

Output: 1

Explanation:

First, remove the substring "ab", leaving "aab". Next, remove the new substring "ab", leaving "a". No further removals are possible, so the minimum length is 1.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is either `'a'` or `'b'`.
