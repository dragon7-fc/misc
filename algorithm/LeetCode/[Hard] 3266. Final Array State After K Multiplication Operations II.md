3266. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations II

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer `multiplier`.

You need to perform `k` operations on `nums`. In each operation:

* Find the **minimum** value `x` in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears **first**.
* Replace the selected minimum value `x` with `x * multiplier`.
* After the `k` operations, apply **modulo** `109 + 7` to every value in `nums`.

Return an integer array denoting the final state of `nums` after performing all `k` operations and then applying the modulo.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2

Output: [8,4,6,5,6]

Explanation:

Operation	Result
After operation 1	[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 2	[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 3	[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 4	[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After operation 5	[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After applying modulo	[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [100000,2000], k = 2, multiplier = 1000000

Output: [999999307,999999993]

Explanation:

Operation	Result
After operation 1	[100000, 2000000000]
After operation 2	[100000000000, 2000000000]
After applying modulo	[999999307, 999999993]
```

**Constraints:**

`1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
`1 <= k <= 10^9`
`1 <= multiplier <= 10^6`
