1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations

Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to transform string `s` into string `t` using the following operation any number of times:

* Choose a **non-empty** substring in `s` and sort it in-place so the characters are in **ascending** order.

For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in `"14234"` results in `"12344"`.

Return `true` if it is possible to transform string `s` into string `t`. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "84532", t = "34852"
Output: true
Explanation: You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
"84532" (from index 2 to 3) -> "84352"
"84352" (from index 0 to 2) -> "34852"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "34521", t = "23415"
Output: true
Explanation: You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
"34521" -> "23451"
"23451" -> "23415"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "12345", t = "12435"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "1", t = "2"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `s.length == t.length`
* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` and `t` only contain digits from `'0'` to `'9'`.

**Solution 1: (Hash Table, Stack, Reverse location list)**

Very tricky question!

1. Probably the hardest part is to realize that: For every digit in t you find the first occurrence in s. Call that current digit as key. We need to make sure in s, no digit smaller than key appears to the left.
1. As we check one-by-one, we need to remove the digits we considered from s. In order to do this operation constant time, store all indices in reversed form using stack. Then use the pop operation in the second loop.

    def isTransformable(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        #places: this stores the indices of every digit from 0 to 9
        places = defaultdict(list)
        for i in reversed(range(len(s))):
            key = int(s[i])
            places[key].append(i)
        
        for e in t: #we loop over t and check every digit
            key = int(e) #current digit
            if not places[key]: #digit is not in s, return False
                return False 
            i = places[key][-1] #location of current digit
            for j in range(key): #only loop over digits smaller than current digit
                if places[j]: #there is a digit smaller than current digit, return false
                    if places[j][-1] < i: 
                        return False
            places[key].pop()
        
        return True
