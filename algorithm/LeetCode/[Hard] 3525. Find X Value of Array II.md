3525. Find X Value of Array II

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`. You are also given a 2D array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [indexi, valuei, starti, xi]`.

You are allowed to perform an operation **once** on `nums`, where you can remove any **suffix** from `nums` such that `nums` remains **non-empty**.

The **x-value** of `nums` for a given `x` is defined as the number of ways to perform this operation so that the **product** of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of `x` modulo `k`.

For each query in `queries` you need to determine the **x-value** of `nums` for xi after performing the following actions:

* Update `nums[indexi]` to `valuei`. Only this step persists for the rest of the queries.
* **Remove** the prefix `nums[0..(starti - 1)]` (where `nums[0..(-1)]` will be used to represent the empty prefix).

Return an array `result` of size `queries.length` where `result[i]` is the answer for the `i`th query.

A **prefix** of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it.

A **suffix** of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array.

**Note** that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be **empty**.

**Note** that x-value has a different definition in this version.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3, queries = [[2,2,0,2],[3,3,3,0],[0,1,0,1]]

Output: [2,2,2]

Explanation:

For query 0, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 4, 5], and the empty prefix must be removed. The possible operations are:
Remove the suffix [2, 4, 5]. nums becomes [1, 2].
Remove the empty suffix. nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] with a product 80, which gives remainder 2 when divided by 3.
For query 1, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5], and the prefix [1, 2, 2] must be removed. The possible operations are:
Remove the empty suffix. nums becomes [3, 5].
Remove the suffix [5]. nums becomes [3].
For query 2, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5], and the empty prefix must be removed. The possible operations are:
Remove the suffix [2, 2, 3, 5]. nums becomes [1].
Remove the suffix [3, 5]. nums becomes [1, 2, 2].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,8,16,32], k = 4, queries = [[0,2,0,2],[0,2,0,1]]

Output: [1,0]

Explanation:

For query 0, nums becomes [2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. The only possible operation is:
Remove the suffix [2, 4, 8, 16, 32].
For query 1, nums becomes [2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]. There is no possible way to perform the operation.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 2, queries = [[2,1,0,1]]

Output: [5]
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= 5`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 10^4`
* `queries[i] == [indexi, valuei, starti, xi]`
* `0 <= indexi <= nums.length - 1`
* `1 <= valuei <= 10^9`
* `0 <= starti <= nums.length - 1`
* `0 <= xi <= k - 1`

**Solution 1: (Segment Tree)**

__Intuition__
We know that in a segment tree, each node contains some information ranging from left index to right index.
Key points: In this issue, we need to record two information into the segment tree node.

The product value from left index to right index.
E.g. the value of (left * left+1 * ... right-1 * right) % k.
The remainder of all prefix product value from left index to right index.
E.g. remainder(left), remainder(left * left+1), ... remainder(left * left+1 *... * right).
We can just use a frequency array to record it because we don't need to know how this remainder is generated from which subarray.
You can also look at the code directly, there are also some comments on it.
Q: Why we record the frequency count of prefix product remainder?
A: Because the start index is fixed in each query, the only thing that can be changed is the deletion position of the suffix.
Therefore, the node representing the range [start, n-1] can just list all the remainder values with different suffix.

__Approach__
Doing the modulo operation on all values ​​by k first can avoid the overflow and keep the same property.
When we want to merge two node from continues segment [left, mid] and [mid+1, right] to new node [left, right], we need to merge these two information.

For the product value, we can easily multiply the two nodes' values ​​together.
For the remainder array, the left part value will be kept because the prefix of left part still exist in the merge part.
E.g. (left), (left, left+1) still is the prefix in the range [left, right].
For the right part, both of them need to multiply with left.product because we need to change the product subarray from [mid+1, ... right] to [left, ... mid, mid+1, ... right].

__Complexity__
Time complexity:
O(k * (n + q * log n)), build for O(n), and each search O(logn), and each operation need O(k) to update the node

Space complexity:
O(n)
