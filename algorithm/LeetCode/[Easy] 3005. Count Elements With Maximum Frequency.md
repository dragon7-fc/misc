3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

Return the **total frequencies** of elements in `nums` such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
