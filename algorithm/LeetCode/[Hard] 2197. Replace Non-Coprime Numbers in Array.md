2197. Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following steps:

1. Find **any** two **adjacent** numbers in `nums` that are **non-coprime**.
1. If no such numbers are found, **stop** the process.
1. Otherwise, delete the two numbers and **replace** them with their **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**.
1. **Repeat** this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.

Return the **final** modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in **any** arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `10^8`.

Two values `x` and `y` are **non-coprime** if `GCD(x, y) > 1` where `GCD(x, y)` is the **Greatest Common Divisor** of `x` and `y`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]
Output: [12,7,6]
Explanation: 
- (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
- (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
- (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [12,7,6].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3,3]
Output: [2,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3].
- (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3].
- (2, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(2, 2) = 2. Now, nums = [2,1,1,3].
There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
Thus, the final modified array is [2,1,1,3].
Note that there are other ways to obtain the same resultant array.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are **less than or equal** to `10^8`.
