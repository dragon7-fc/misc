3273. Minimum Amount of Damage Dealt to Bob

You are given an integer `power` and two integer arrays `damage` and `health`, both having length `n`.

Bob has `n` enemies, where enemy `i` will deal Bob `damage[i]` **points** of damage per second while they are alive (i.e. `health[i] > 0`).

Every second, **after** the enemies deal damage to Bob, he chooses **one** of the enemies that is still alive and deals power points of damage to them.

Determine the **minimum** total amount of damage points that will be dealt to Bob before **all** `n` enemies are dead.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: power = 4, damage = [1,2,3,4], health = [4,5,6,8]

Output: 39

Explanation:

Attack enemy 3 in the first two seconds, after which enemy 3 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 10 + 10 = 20 points.
Attack enemy 2 in the next two seconds, after which enemy 2 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 6 + 6 = 12 points.
Attack enemy 0 in the next second, after which enemy 0 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 3 points.
Attack enemy 1 in the next two seconds, after which enemy 1 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 2 + 2 = 4 points.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: power = 1, damage = [1,1,1,1], health = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 20

Explanation:

Attack enemy 0 in the first second, after which enemy 0 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 4 points.
Attack enemy 1 in the next two seconds, after which enemy 1 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 3 + 3 = 6 points.
Attack enemy 2 in the next three seconds, after which enemy 2 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 points.
Attack enemy 3 in the next four seconds, after which enemy 3 will go down, the number of damage points dealt to Bob is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 points.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: power = 8, damage = [40], health = [59]

Output: 320
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= power <= 10^4`
`1 <= n == damage.length == health.length <= 10^5`
`1 <= damage[i], health[i] <= 10^4`
