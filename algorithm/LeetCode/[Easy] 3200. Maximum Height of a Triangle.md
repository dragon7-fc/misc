3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle

You are given two integers `red` and `blue` representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.

All the balls in a particular row should be the **same** color, and adjacent rows should have **different** colors.

Return the **maximum** height of the triangle that can be achieved.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: red = 2, blue = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:



The only possible arrangement is shown above.

**Example 3:**
```
Input: red = 1, blue = 1

Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**
