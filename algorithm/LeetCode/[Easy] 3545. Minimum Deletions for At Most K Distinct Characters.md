3545. Minimum Deletions for At Most K Distinct Characters

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`.

Your task is to delete some (possibly none) of the characters in the string so that the number of distinct characters in the resulting string is **at most** `k`.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions required to achieve this.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abc", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation:

s has three distinct characters: 'a', 'b' and 'c', each with a frequency of 1.
Since we can have at most k = 2 distinct characters, remove all occurrences of any one character from the string.
For example, removing all occurrences of 'c' results in at most k distinct characters. Thus, the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aabb", k = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:

s has two distinct characters ('a' and 'b') with frequencies of 2 and 2, respectively.
Since we can have at most k = 2 distinct characters, no deletions are required. Thus, the answer is 0.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "yyyzz", k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

s has two distinct characters ('y' and 'z') with frequencies of 3 and 2, respectively.
Since we can have at most k = 1 distinct character, remove all occurrences of any one character from the string.
Removing all 'z' results in at most k distinct characters. Thus, the answer is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 16`
* `1 <= k <= 16`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
