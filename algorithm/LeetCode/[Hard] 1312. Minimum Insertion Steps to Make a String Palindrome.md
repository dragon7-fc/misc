1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome

Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` palindrome.

**A Palindrome String** is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "mbadm"
Output: 2
Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 5
Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "g"
Output: 0
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "no"
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* All characters of `s` are lower case English letters.

**Solution 1:**

**Intuition**
Split the string `s` into to two parts,
and we try to make them symmetrical by adding letters.

The more common symmetrical subsequence they have,
the less letters we need to add.

Now we change the problem to find the length of longest common sequence.
This is a typical dynamic problem.


**Explanation**

* Step1. Initialize `dp[n+1][n+1]`

where `dp[i][j]` means the length of longest common sequence between
`i` first letters in `s1` and `j` first letters in `s2`.

* Step2: Find the the longest common sequence between `s1` and `s2`,

where `s1 = s` and `s2 = reversed(s)`

* Step3: return `n - dp[n][n]`


**Complexity**

* Time O(N^2)
* Space O(N^2)

                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j])

        return N - dp[N][N]
