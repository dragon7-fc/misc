1012. Numbers With Repeated Digits

Given a positive integer `N`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `N` that have at least 1 repeated digit.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 20
Output: 1
Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 100
Output: 10
Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: 1000
Output: 262
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= N <= 10^9`

More of the same approach:
* 902. Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set
* 788. Rotated Digits
* 1397. Find All Good Strings
* 233. Number of Digit One
* 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits
* 600. Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones

At each recursive call (adding digit to less significant position) compute:

* isPrefix - if the new number is the prefix of N
* isBigger - if the new number will be bigger than N when we reach final position
* digits - current digits of the new number
* repeated - if there is already a repeated digit
* Optimization - if there is already a repeated number and the current number cannot be bigger than N when we reach the last position we can add 10 (for 10 digits) to the result and every subresult gets multiplied by 10.
