3470. Permutations IV

Given two integers, `n` and `k`, an **alternating permutation** is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers such that no two adjacent elements are both odd or both even.

Return the k-th **alternating permutation** sorted in lexicographical order. If there are fewer than k valid alternating permutations, return an empty list.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4, k = 6

Output: [3,4,1,2]

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4] are:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 4, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 4, 3]
[2, 3, 4, 1]
[3, 2, 1, 4]
[3, 4, 1, 2] ← 6th permutation
[4, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 3, 2, 1]
Since k = 6, we return [3, 4, 1, 2].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 2

Output: [3,2,1]

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2, 3] are:

[1, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 1] ← 2nd permutation
Since k = 2, we return [3, 2, 1].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 2, k = 3

Output: []

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2] are:

[1, 2]
[2, 1]
There are only 2 alternating permutations, but k = 3, which is out of range. Thus, we return an empty list [].
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 10^15`

**Solution 1: (DFS + Perm Pruning with Counting/Maths)**

__Intuition__
The problem requires finding the K-th lexicographically smallest alternating permutation of the first n natural numbers. Instead of generating all permutations, we can leverage factorial counting and DFS pruning to efficiently construct the answer.

Key Observations:
Alternating condition: Adjacent numbers must have different parity (odd/even).
Total valid permutations:
If n is odd: odd -> even -> odd .... -> odd:
fact(oddNum) × fact(evenNum)
If n is even: odd -> even -> ... -> even or even -> odd .... -> odd, 2 possibilities, so:
2 × fact(oddNum) × fact(evenNum)
At position i, the remaining valid permutations if it is already decided which parity is to be placed here (even or odd):
fact(oddNumLeft) × fact(evenNumLeft)
__Approach__
Precompute Factorials:
To efficiently determine the number of valid permutations from any position, precompute factorials up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 20!) since values beyond this will overflow.
Store factorials in an array fact[] where fact[i] = i * fact[i - 1].
Use DFS with Counting and Pruning:
Maintain two sets of numbers: odd numbers and even numbers.
At each position i, decide whether to place an odd or even number based on the alternating pattern.
Always try to place number going from the smallest available number (with the matching parity of position) to the larger ones on the position i to ensure kth permutation in lexicographical order.
Count Remaining Valid Permutations:
For a given number placement, compute how many permutations are possible with the remaining numbers.
If n - i numbers are left, the count of permutations is:
fact((n - i) / 2) × fact((n - i + 1) / 2)
This tells us how many sequences exist starting from the current number.
Prune Unnecessary Branches:
Compare k with the computed count of permutations for a branch.
If k is greater than the count of permutations in the current branch, it means the answer does not exist in this branch.
In this case, k is decremented accordingly, and we move to the next possible number.
Otherwise, we place the current number and recurse further.
Use a Boolean Array to Track Used Numbers:
Maintain an array to mark whether a number has been used.
This prevents duplicate placements and ensures we follow the alternating pattern correctly.
Construct the Answer Recursively:
Continue this process until all positions are filled.
The recursion builds the answer step by step without generating all permutations explicitly.
