3307. Find the K-th Character in String Game II

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`.

You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given an integer array `operations`, where `operations[i]` represents the type of the `i`th operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform **all** operations in sequence:

If `operations[i] == 0`, **append** a copy of `word` to itself.
If `operations[i] == 1`, generate a new string by changing each character in `word` to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original `word`. For example, performing the operation on `"c"` generates `"cd"` and performing the operation on `"zb"` generates `"zbac"`.

Return the value of the `k`th character in `word` after performing all the operations.

Note that the character `'z'` can be changed to `'a'` in the second type of operation.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]

Output: "a"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the three operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "aa" to "aa", word becomes "aaaa".
Appends "aaaa" to "aaaa", word becomes "aaaaaaaa".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: k = 10, operations = [0,1,0,1]

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the four operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "bb" to "aa", word becomes "aabb".
Appends "aabb" to "aabb", word becomes "aabbaabb".
Appends "bbccbbcc" to "aabbaabb", word becomes "aabbaabbbbccbbcc".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= 10^14`
* `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
* `operations[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* The input is generated such that `word` has **at least** `k` characters after all operations.

public:
    char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
        long long r = k-1;
        int i, ans = 0;
        while (r) {
            i = __lg(r);
            r = r % (1LL<<i);
            ans += operations[i];
        }
        return ans%26 + 'a';
    }
};
```

**Solution 2: (Bit Manipulation, O(log(k)))**

We need to find how many times the character a mutated to get to the position k.

We first determine the index op of the final operation: log2(k). The size of the word would be 2 ^ (log2(k) + 1).
Now, we divide the word by half until only one character remains (a). If k is in the right half of the word:

we increase the number of mutations if operations[op] is 1.
we subtract the half size of the word from k to move it to the "parent" character.
Finally, we apply mutations to a to get the result.

            if (k > (1LL << op)) {
                mutations += operations[op];
                k -= 1LL << op;
            }
        return 'a' + mutations % 26;
    }
};
```
