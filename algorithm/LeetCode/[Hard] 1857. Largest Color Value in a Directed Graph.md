1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph

There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the **color** of the ith node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are also given a 2D array edges where `edges[j] = [aj, bj]` indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node `aj` to node `bj`.

A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk` such that there is a directed edge from `xi` to `xi+1` for every `1 <= i < k`. The **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the **most frequently** occurring color along that path.

Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or `-1` if the graph contains a cycle.

 

**Example 1:**


```
Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).
```

**Example 2:**


```
Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is a cycle from 0 to 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == colors.length`
* `m == edges.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= m <= 10^5`
* `colors` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `0 <= aj, bj < n`
