1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination

Given the `edges` of a directed graph where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`, that is:

* At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
* If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.
* The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.

 

**Example 1:**

![1059_485_example_1.png](img/1059_485_example_1.png)
```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![1059_485_example_2.png](img/1059_485_example_2.png)
```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
```

**Example 3:**

![1059_485_example_3.png](img/1059_485_example_3.png)
```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^4`
* `edges.length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
* `0 <= source <= n - 1`
* `0 <= destination <= n - 1`
* The given graph may have self-loops and parallel edges.
