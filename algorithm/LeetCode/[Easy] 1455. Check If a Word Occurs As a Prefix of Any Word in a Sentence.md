1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`.

You have to check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return the index of the word in `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word (**1-indexed**).

If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return `-1`.

A prefix of a string `S` is any leading contiguous substring of `S`.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: sentence = "i use triple pillow", searchWord = "pill"
Output: 4
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: sentence = "hello from the other side", searchWord = "they"
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 10`
* `sentence` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
* `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
