3420. Count Non-Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.

For each subarray of `nums`, you can apply up to `k` operations on it. In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by 1.

**Note** that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.

Return the number of subarrays that you can make **non-decreasing** after performing at most `k` operations.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [6,3,1,2,4,4], k = 7

Output: 17

Explanation:

Out of all 21 possible subarrays of nums, only the subarrays [6, 3, 1], [6, 3, 1, 2], [6, 3, 1, 2, 4] and [6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4] cannot be made non-decreasing after applying up to k = 7 operations. Thus, the number of non-decreasing subarrays is 21 - 4 = 17.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [6,3,1,3,6], k = 4

Output: 12

Explanation:

The subarray [3, 1, 3, 6] along with all subarrays of nums with three or fewer elements, except [6, 3, 1], can be made non-decreasing after k operations. There are 5 subarrays of a single element, 4 subarrays of two elements, and 2 subarrays of three elements except [6, 3, 1], so there are 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12 subarrays that can be made non-decreasing.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`

**Solution 1: (Mono Decreasing Deque)**

__Intuition__
Solve it in one-pass with stack + sliding window.

__GPT Explanation__
Reverse the Array: The array is reversed to allow handling non-decreasing subarrays using a monotonic decreasing property while iterating forward.

Deque for Monotonic Stack: The deque (q) is used to maintain indices of elements in a decreasing order as we process the array. This helps efficiently track the ranges of subarrays and the cost of making them non-decreasing.

Sliding Window: The solution uses a sliding window approach with pointers i and j. j represents the current end of the window, and i represents its start.

Maintaining the Monotonicity:

While adding a new element at index j to the deque, if it breaks the monotonicity (i.e., it's greater than the last element in the deque), elements are popped from the deque.
For every popped element, the contribution of its range to the "cost" (k) is subtracted.
Adjusting the Window:

If the cost exceeds k after including the current subarray, the window's start (i) is advanced until the cost is within bounds.
While doing this, elements at the start of the deque are also removed if they are no longer part of the window.
Count Valid Subarrays: The number of valid subarrays ending at j is added to the result (res) as j - i + 1.

        for (int j = 0, i = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            while (!q.empty() && nums[q.back()] < nums[j]) {
                int r = q.back();
                q.pop_back();
                int l = q.empty() ? i - 1 : q.back();
                k -= 1L * (r - l) * (nums[j] - nums[r]);
            }
            q.push_back(j);
            while (k < 0) {
                k += nums[q.front()] - nums[i];
