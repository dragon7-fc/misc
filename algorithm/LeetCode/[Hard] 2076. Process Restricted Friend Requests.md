2076. Process Restricted Friend Requests

You are given an integer `n` indicating the number of people in a network. Each person is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `restrictions`, where `restrictions[i] = [xi, yi]` means that person `xi` and person `yi` **cannot become friends**, either **directly** or **indirectly** through other people.

Initially, no one is friends with each other. You are given a list of friend requests as a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `requests`, where `requests[j] = [uj, vj]` is a friend request between person `uj` and person `vj`.

A friend request is **successful** if `uj` and `vj` can be friends. Each friend request is processed in the given order (i.e., `requests[j]` occurs before `requests[j + 1])`, and upon a successful request, `uj` and `vj` **become direct friends** for all future friend requests.

Return a **boolean array** result, where each `result[j]` is `true` if the `j`th friend request is **successful** or `false` if it is not.

**Note:** If `uj` and `vj` are already direct friends, the request is still **successful**.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[0,2],[2,1]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends. 
Request 1: Person 2 and person 1 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (1--2--0).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, restrictions = [[0,1]], requests = [[1,2],[0,2]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 1 and person 2 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 1: Person 0 and person 2 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--2--1).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[3,1],[3,4]]
Output: [true,false,true,false]
Explanation:
Request 0: Person 0 and person 4 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 1: Person 1 and person 2 cannot be friends since they are directly restricted.
Request 2: Person 3 and person 1 can be friends, so they become direct friends.
Request 3: Person 3 and person 4 cannot be friends since person 0 and person 1 would be indirect friends (0--4--3--1).
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `0 <= restrictions.length <= 1000`
* `restrictions[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1`
* `xi != yi`
* `1 <= requests.length <= 1000`
* `requests[j].length == 2`
* `0 <= uj, vj <= n - 1`
* `uj != vj`
