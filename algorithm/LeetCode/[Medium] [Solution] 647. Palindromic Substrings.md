647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

**Note:**

* The input string length won't exceed 1000.

## Approach #1: Expand Around Center [Accepted]
Intuition

Let `N` be the length of the string. The middle of the palindrome could be in one of `2N - 1` positions: either at letter or between two letters.

For each center, let's count all the palindromes that have this center. Notice that if `[a, b]` is a palindromic interval (meaning `S[a], S[a+1], ..., S[b]` is a palindrome), then `[a+1, b-1]` is one too.

**Algorithm**

For each possible palindrome center, let's expand our candidate palindrome on the interval `[left, right]` as long as we can. The condition for expanding is `left >= 0` and `right < N` and `S[left] == S[right]`. That means we want to count a new palindrome `S[left], S[left+1], ..., S[right]`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, S):
        N = len(S)
        ans = 0
        for center in xrange(2*N - 1):
            left = center / 2
            right = left + center % 2
            while left >= 0 and right < N and S[left] == S[right]:
                ans += 1
                left -= 1
                right += 1
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is the length of `S`. Each expansion might do $O(N)$ work.

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$.

## Approach #2: Manacher's Algorithm [Accepted]
**Intuition**

Manacher's algorithm is a textbook algorithm that finds in linear time, the maximum size palindrome for any possible palindrome center. If we had such an algorithm, finding the answer is straightforward.

What follows is a discussion of why this algorithm works.

**Algorithm**

Our loop invariants will be that `center, right` is our knowledge of the palindrome with the largest right-most boundary with `center < i`, centered at `center` with right-boundary `right`. Also, `i > center`, and we've already computed all `Z[j]`'s for `j < i`.

When `i < right`, we reflect `i` about center to be at some coordinate `j = 2 * center - i`. Then, limited to the interval with radius `right - i` and center `i`, the situation for `Z[i]` is the same as for `Z[j]`.

For example, if at some time `center = 7, right = 13, i = 10`, then for a string like `A = '@#A#B#A#A#B#A#ï¼„'`, the center is at the `'#'` between the two middle `'A'`'s, the right boundary is at the last `'#'`, `i` is at the last `'B'`, and `j` is at the first `'B'`.

Notice that limited to the interval `[center - (right - center), right]` (the interval with center `center` and right-boundary `right`), the situation for `i` and `j` is a reflection of something we have already computed. Since we already know `Z[j] = 3`, we can quickly find `Z[i] = min(right - i, Z[j]) = 3`.

Now, why is this algorithm linear? The while loop only checks the condition more than once when `Z[i] = right - i`. In that case, for each time `Z[i] += 1`, it increments right, and right can only be incremented up to `2*N+2` times.

Finally, we sum up `(v+1) / 2` for each `v` in `Z`. Say the longest palindrome with some given center `C` has radius `R`. Then, the substring with center `C` and radius `R-1, R-2, R-3, ..., 0` are also palindromes. Example: `abcdedcba` is a palindrome with center `e`, radius `4`: but `e`, `ded`, `cdedc`, `bcdedcb`, and `abcdedcba` are all palindromes.

We are dividing by 2 because we were using half-lengths instead of lengths. For example we actually had the palindrome `a#b#c#d#e#d#c#b#a`, so our length is twice as big.

```python
def countSubstrings(self, S):
    def manachers(S):
        A = '@#' + '#'.join(S) + '#$'
        Z = [0] * len(A)
        center = right = 0
        for i in xrange(1, len(A) - 1):
            if i < right:
                Z[i] = min(right - i, Z[2 * center - i])
            while A[i + Z[i] + 1] == A[i - Z[i] - 1]:
                Z[i] += 1
            if i + Z[i] > right:
                center, right = i, i + Z[i]
        return Z

    return sum((v+1)/2 for v in manachers(S))
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$ where $N$ is the length of `S`. As discussed above, the complexity is linear.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, the size of `A` and `Z`.

**Solution 3: (DP Bottom-Up)**

Start from the smallest palindrome.  
It is either:
* a single character, which is a palindrome by definition
    * example: "a"
* two characters that are the same
    * example: "aa"
    
+ To determine if bigger substring is a palindrome you should know

    * if the inner substring is the palindrome and
    * if the outer characters match
