3276. Select Cells in Grid With Maximum Score

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.

You have to select one or more cells from the matrix such that the following conditions are satisfied:

* No two selected cells are in the **same** row of the matrix.
* The values in the set of selected cells are **unique**.

Your score will be the **sum** of the values of the selected cells.

Return the **maximum** score you can achieve.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,3,2],[1,1,1]]

Output: 8

Explanation:

```
We can select the cells with values 1, 3, and 4 that are colored above.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[8,7,6],[8,3,2]]

Output: 15

Explanation:
```

```
We can select the cells with values 7 and 8 that are colored above.
```
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 10`
`1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
